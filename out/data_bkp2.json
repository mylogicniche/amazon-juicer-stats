        "text": "Best juicer i've owned. I used to own a centifrugal juicer and i decided to go for masticating because masticating is supposed to better for you. After a lot of research, i picked this one for starter with all the good reviews. Works great and it really does yield more juice than the centifrugal. I find it easier to wash too. Only thing i didn't like very much is you need to cut the vegetables and fruits very small to fit in the feeder.",

        "text": "I'm not sure I can really add anything new to the nearly 600 comments about this juicer. I searched for hours and hours online and watched numerous videos on various pros and cons of different juicers. What I quickly discovered is there is no one perfect juicer-- they all are some degree of a compromise.\nSince I was primarily concerned with extracting maximum nutrition from leafy greens, this style juicer seem to really shine. The only real fruits I put through this machine are apples, and cucumber. I tend to buy very small apples and cucumbers for this reason-- you don't want anything super soft. Always follow something soft with something hard. A cucumber, than a carrot. An Apple followed by some celery, etc. If the machine does become clogged, it's a simple matter of reversing it, and starting again.\nA nice added plus for me is the ability to make nut butters. This is something I had not even considered for a juicer. This makes absolutely delicious cashew nut butter or peanut butter. Anything that does not contain a lot of oils is a little more difficult, such as almonds, but multiple passes makes a decent paste. You can always add a little bit of oil yourself to the final blend, but hey, this is a juicer after all.\nI also make sorbets with this almost daily. Just grab any frozen fruit you want and run it through a few times. I touch of a agave nectar or a splash of almond milk, and you got a absolutely delicious sorbet. With the blender you need to make several cups at least, but you can make a half cup with this if you desire, and that's an added plus.\nCleanup is a breeze. When you make nut butters, you do need to fill the sink with soapy water, and use a brush on a number of parts, but I don't think any machine would be immune from extra cleaning with oils.\nOverall, I'm really happy with this machine. It seems extremely robust, simple in design, quiet, and to me fairly reasonably priced at $239 with free shipping.\nThe only other machine I would possibly consider would be the Omeaga Vert 350, and it lacks the blank plate that this one does. I've really gotten to like the ability to make nut butters and sorbets.\nAbout the only negative thing I can say about this is I wish it had a larger feed chute. It really doesn't take all that much extra time to slice up apples or cucumbers though. Carrots celery and most other things go in whole. I'm told that celery can sometimes clog the auger, but I've never had that issue.",

However, keep in mind that everyone has a different definition for easy! I did find the juicer simple to operate and put together, but there were a few steps involved.  There were several pieces to put in place, and we did not like the fact that the chute was so small.  I got this juicer for my whole family to use, but mostly for my 16 year old son, who is a wrestler.  I also thought my husband would help him out with it because they travel to tournaments together.  For our first experience, we all assembled the juicer and prepared our first juice together.  The guys felt that the clean up was too much because you need to empty the pulp container, then clean the strainer, juice reservoir and other pieces.  They also did not want to cut the fruit and veggies into small pieces.  So I sent it back knowing it would not be utilized as planned.  We had the Health Master, which we all loved because you can put whole fruit and veggies in and only have the container to clean (minimal prep and cleanup).  However, the motor had problems.  Next, we will try the Vitamix.",

If you're looking for a juicer, do some research cause different style juicers are better for juicing different items.  This one is good for leafy greens and although it does fruit well, I think there are others that might be better.

        "title": "Great results, easy to use, easy to clean, verstile, but a small opening",
        "text": "I had forgotten and mainly never knew that Orange Juice could taste so good. I have never had my own juicer and the results I get here surpass any fresh squeezed at the restaurant juice I have ever had. I had been buying juice from the store and did not know what real, fresh-squeezed juice can taste like. WOW. This juicer produces amazing, tasty juice. It is extremely easy to use, assemble, disassemble, clean, and set up again. I am new to juicing and if you are searching for a juicer and deciding whether to invest in one that costs this much here is what I think you should consider.\nMasticating juicer versus a centrifuge juicer. Virtually all lower price juicers (lower than $200) are centrifuge juicers. There are also centrifuge juicers that cost much more than the 8006. I highly suggest using the web to find sites that compare the two. After reading a variety of those sites I knew I wanted a masticating juicer. I am not a biochemist but a lot of the sites claim that centrifuge juicers produce so much heat that can kill enzymes, produce more oxidation, and generally reduce the nutritional benefits of any particular juice you create. I am not here to vouch for that but I can vouch for the following. This juicer is extremely quiet (it is moving at only 70-80 RPM versus 10,000 or more), extremely easy to use, and produces virtually no foam whatsoever, matching other benefits that were mentioned on the web. I also found many sites saying that juice from a masticating juicer will last longer but be aware that you will want to try and drink juice from any juicer fairly soon.\nAlso while I cannot claim to have done a side by side comparison most sites claim around 20% more juice produced by a masticating juicer. So you are getting into juicing. It would be easy to spend say $10 a week on produce. If you got 20% more juice you are getting $2 more worth of juice a week compared to a centrifuge juicer. Or $104 more worth of juice a year. After a few years you have paid for the cost of the juicer.\nThe small opening is not really much of a hassle. Certainly not for citrus which I thought it would be. The effort with citrus is peeling it. Cutting smaller pieces after that is virtually no extra work. I also bought this juicer because of the 15 year warranty. Or 10 year warranty. The box itself it comes in clearly states 15 years so Omega should have to honor that. The card inside says 10 years. Either way the warranty fairly blows away lower priced juicers and probably higher priced centrifuges.\nThe only negative I have experienced so far is the very poorly written manual. There is no section, zero, about cleaning. You just have to figure it out. Fortunately that is pretty easy to figure out. They also did not include a single page of recipes. And the confusing warranty length? That speaks to me again about Omega's poorly run documentation side. Really no one at Omega knows the card they put into the box states something different from the box itself, not a single person there said gee this is different? There is also no way to fill the registration online. Omega does have a website, but most employ the same level of web designers as they do manual writers. Just absurdly bad in those areas. One last thing about negatives. Being a juicer novice I read through the negative reviews here. Most of them come down to saying that parts of the auger (or drill that is pounding the bezessas out of your fruit and vegetables and producing the juice) they found flaking off and showing up on the screen. I have not experienced that at all. Since I am not reviewing the manual per se and I am enjoying the juicer quite a lot otherwise, I did not take off a star.\nBottom line, this is an extremely easy to use and VERSTILE juicer that produces great results. My wife and I grow our own lettuce in the fall and winter. While I haven't tried it yet, we are going to try our Swiss chard and may even try wheatgrass. While a masticating juicer like the 8006 can handle all the juicing a centrifuge one can (albeit with a smaller opening) according to everything I read they are much better with lettuces and especially wheatgrass. So for me this was a great decision. Very quiet, easy to use, produces great results, produces more juice, and an extremely long warranty. I highly recommend research if you are in the market for a juicer that costs this much and at minimum researching masticating versus centrifuge juicers. If you decide on a masticating one, then I for one am very happy with the 8006.",

When I was juicing I would toss the pulp into a trashcan as the recommendations to just dump the pulp down the garbage disposal is a practice just begging for a major event to happen.  It does require some assembly to get going and cleaning it up, but once you've done it a few times it takes 2-3 minutes tops depending on your fastidious levels and the motor is rock solid and strong.  It had no problem chewing through even tough vegetable fiber and wrung a heck of a lot more juice out of whatever I put into it than several other centrifugal juicers I tested it against.",

I'll update this review with the outcome. Aside from this, I'm very impressed. It's a very cool kitchen gadget.\nEdit: I contacted Omega on Saturday. Sunday they responded, saying the replacement auger would be mailed on Monday. It's Wednesday at 10:30am and the new auger just arrived. If IT breaks, I'll update this review. Aside from the issue, I've LOVED the juicer. I ran about 15 pounds of carrots through yesterday with the cracked auger, and had absolutely no problem.",

It's very simple to use, easy to clean and assemble (only 4 big pieces!) and the pulp is sufficiently dry to make me feel like no juice is being wasted.  A masticating juicer, like this one, is far better at preserving the quality of the vitamins and nutrients in your fruits and vegetables too.\nI also love that it comes with attachments for grinding meat or making nut butters and making breadsticks and noodles!\nThe quality and price of this product can't be beat.",

I always drink the juice right after I make it, so I don't know how well it keeps. The pulp is very dry, so it does extract a lot of juice.

Even at $206 I wasn't about to jump in and buy something that made no sense to me.\nLike one reviewer mentioned, the cleanup is where he falters; this is my case as well. If using this thing, cleaning this thing, and storing this thing are nothing short of a pain in the rear, I won't use it much more than a few times.  The novelty will wear off and I'll want my counter back.\nCleaning:\nThis is a huge deal to just about everyone, I think.  There are 8 pieces that you will have to clean after juicing; pusher, collection bowl (2), juicing screen, auger, hopper (funnel), drum cap, and the drum (the part the auger sits in).  If you use the sieve then you have to clean that.  Tear down and rinse takes less than 4 minutes (includes time for water to get warm and me to dump the pulp extracted). Not counting any time for anything else, the 2 minute clean up is indeed pretty accurate. I let the parts dry in a dish rack until I am ready to use them again.\nStoring:\nI am not as limited on counter space as some are, but I don't like cluttered counters. With a mixer, coffee pot, canisters for whatever, and a toaster oven, I am pretty well set on counter space. I feel as though this doesn't exactly spare space but it is not so overwhelmingly huge that you feel like you couldn't work on the counter in front of the machine (if stored against the wall with the logo facing you).  If space is an issue, the built in handle is fantastic and you can easily drop this into a cupboard. If you're juicing multiple times a day then that would get tedious.\nNoise:\nIf you've ever owned a Magic Bullet then you will be pleased with the noise level. I understand the RPMs are like night and day, but the Bullet is so loud I always felt bad using it in the morning. I can have a conversation on the phone while juicing and not feel horrible about it.\nFruit Juice:\nAfter doing much research I was learning that masticating juicers were great for greens whereas the centrifuge juicers were better for fruit. I've never owned another juicer so I can't speak to that. I will say that I understand where the design lends to greens more so than fruit (like oranges or lemons). Oranges in this thing tend to juice pretty well but I think having to cut the peel and rind off is a pain. I think I'd rather eat my orange. If only to curb the green flavor, I will put \u00bd orange in the machine. Apples did well, which seems to be completely different than many peoples' experiences. I used green apples and have recently bought some cameo apples to try.  I tried a banana and I guess it went okay. I think if I froze the banana then it may have been better but that was just a spur of the moment idea that I don't plan to make a big part of my juicing.  Blueberries did surprisingly well but I understand these are better in a blender. To each their own.  Those are all the fruits I've tried in 2 days since owning this machine.\nGreens:\nThis thing was supposed to be great for wheat grass. I must have done something wrong because the grass went in and quickly just hung out around the auger until other things pushed it through. I know I got the juice, but for straight wheat grass, I am not sure. This could be user error. Kale is awesome. It is easy, it does squeak a bit but overall, most of my juice has been had through the use of kale.  Carrots, this thing juices carrots very well. I don't seem to have lumpy juice and the collection of pulp suggests they feed and release quite well. Cucumbers are different. They seem to do just fine but I did the wheat grass then cucumber next and I don't think that was really going well for me. I guess I need to think about the grass, kale, cucumber, then carrot. There was something said about rotating what you're juicing and I think I understand the reason for the concept.  I have not tried any other greens yet.\nI don't know if I'll set out on a juice fast anytime soon. I don't think it is safe to jump into that without more research. This model does really do well and I have learned that there is no real one-stop shop for a juicer that does everything well. I think if this does fruit okay and greens well, that I would rather have greens be easy and fruit secondary since I think the health benefits are better from greens.  I understand the VERT or VRT model does fruit better and still does greens well, but I think people say that for leafy greens the 8006 is better. One could go crazy trying to really figure it all out. If you just want fruit juice then I think you need more research though. I don't believe this is the machine for you.\nJuicing Time:\nJuicing on the VRT is quicker, no doubt (all the videos prove that). Reading reviews and watching videos is important because some of the poor reviews I read on the 8006 and VRT model make me realize that some people just don't research. That is okay, but then try to understand that many of the questions and concerns can be answered through even 30 minutes online. With a purchase that has this kind of price tag, 30 minutes is nothing compared to the headache of having to hate what you bought and return it.  For me, the juicing time isn't so much of a thing; the prep time is.  Prep time, in my opinion between the two, is quite similar. While the VRT has a large chute, I don't really feel like you're saving as much time. If you can find a juicer where you can toss in a quarter orange with rind and peel then we can talk about speed.\nIn the end, I can see that providing I can keep up with the trips to the market every couple of days then I will do okay with having this as a usable kitchen tool for a long time to come.  It is important not to try and buy your produce with the intention of it keeping for over a week (at least that is what I hear) so trips to the store every few days are probably in store for anyone who wants to juice at least twice a day. Any juicer will require this commitment unless you have a flourishing garden in your yard that produces everything you could possibly need. I do not so it is Whole Foods and Fresh Market for me!\nOne last thing, I read this was made in the USA. I don't think that is the case now. There is still a 15-year warranty, but my box clearly states Korea. Now, I didn't do well in geography and I rely heavily on my GPS whenever I leave the house, but I'm pretty sure Korea isn't part of the USA.",

I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to make up to 3 days worth of juice ahead of time. That is what we do. Make sure to put it in a glass bottle/jar poured to the very top for storage.\nSometimes it will clog up and not juice well for a moment but if you press the reverse function or just give it a minute it will reverse itself. That is the only downfall. But I will still give it 5 starts because it is THAT great. If you are looking for a masticating juicer you will not be disappointed.",

I also liked it bcs its more of a hum compared to my noisy juicing machines I've had in the past (jack lalaine / and an old breville model).\nThe handle also makes it very convenient when you need to move it.\nIt has a small mouth so you will need to cut up apples and things in order to feet it into the tube. To me its worth it so I could have a cold press machine!\nJust remember to feed things into it slowly, if you overload it w/ too many greens it will struggle. It works perfectly if you feed it different things in rotation for example: a bit of apple then kale, then piece of carrot.\nThere are videos on youtube that demonstrate this method.\np.s. I enjoy hearing the crunch when I put certain things in like carrot and fennel. You can hear the CRUNCH, its cute.\nHighly recommend!",

        "text": "I am a very experienced Juicer for over 20 years.  I owned a Champion Masticating juicer and loved it but the masticating blade auger kept slipping.  I bought a new masticating blade for 60.00 which I thought was very expensive and it still slipped too and I realized that the main metal axle had worn down and could not be replaced.  In July 2012 after researching many different juicers I chose the Omega J8006 and I am giving it 5 stars for several reasons.  #1.  It is easy to clean up, far easier than the champion and centrifugal units.  #2.  It does NOT create foam like most units do, a plus.  #3.  It will NOT heat up the juice which damages the juice like the champion did and many juicers do, and cold juice is much better to drink than warm juice.  #4. It is very stylish, stainless steel and takes up very little space.  #5.  It is very powerful and will easily handle any fruit or vegetable I put in it.  #6.  It only turns at 90 RPM so the juice stays cold and the enzymes are not destroyed from excessive heat.  #7.  It is one of the very few juicers that will do wheat grass which I use.  #8.  It has a great warranty.  #9. The main auger will never need replaced, no teeth on it.  #9.  It is only 300.00 and not nearly the most expensive.  #10.  It can also be used to make Pasta and is very functional.  #11.  I can clean it up in less than 4 minutes, only 3 pieces to clean.  #12.  It is build to last.  #13.  Omega has been in business longer than most every company out there and they are here to last.  #14.  It is USA made and sold.\nI have been using the juicer for several months now and I use it daily.  If you are going to spend your money on a juicer, this is the system to get. You can get a system cheaper but what it will boil down to is how quickly it cleans up, how much it heats up the juice, how much foam it makes, and if it is able to do fibrous vegetables without plugging up like celery.\nI have done dozens of hours of research and reviews, and did my research properly and I am very pleased with this system and know you will be too.",

But mine does overheat after about 10 minutes of juicing, and it shuts down. I have to wait 15-20 minutes to do another 10 minutes of juicing.  I juiced one gallon today and it overheated four times.

However, the only draw backs I have are:\n-  large fruits and vegs need to be cut down to fit into the juicer.\n- fruits such as apples, oranges, and pears clogs the filter screen. therefore juicing can take a long time.  often I would have to clean the filter screen during juicing\n- cleaning the filter screens is somewhat time consuming. I have ended up buying several more brushes, as I use mine frequently.\nOverall, I am still pleased with this juicer - far far better than the one I had previously.",

It takes about 7-10 minutes all together to make a 16-20 oz. glass of juice. That includes washing and cutting veggies, juicing, and clean up. The juice comes out at a little under room temp, which is pretty good compared to the temp. of other juicers. It is also a masticating juicer and gets a very good yield from the veggies. I paid about $14 for a selection of veggies and apples, and I got about 5 glasses of 16-20 oz. of juice. I made an 18oz. glass of juice with 3 carrots, half a cucumber, three celery stalks, a cup of spinach, one apple, a beet, and a cup of grapes. There is very little pulp in the drink, I don't even notice any until the last drink. There is also hardly any foam at all. I am not being over zealous in this review. In my experience it really does work that great. Priced well for what it does and how well it works. Also comes with attachments to make different kinds of noodles and even grinds coffee. No complaints, love it.",

So I wanted a juicer that would extract the most from leafy greens (kale, spinach, etc) and hard veggies (carrots, celery, etc). I researched extensively and read all of the reviews and decided to try the Omega J8006. At almost $300 it's a hefty investment. It's been over three months, and I am happy to report a high level of satisfaction with this product. It's sturdy and well made and returns nearly dry pulp from veggies. However, it's not as good at separating soft fruits, like tomatoes and citrus, but that is okay with me because when I juice those I don't mind a little pulp. Also, the operation of this juicer is quieter than a blender and other juicers that I tried. Bottom line: if you want to extract the most juice from your expensive veggies, this model is the way to go.",

Not one bit of juice ever comes out from wheat grass unless you push a carrot or something in it. This is the one reason I bought it, to have a high quality juicer and to also juice wheat grass. Repeat, it will not does not juice wheat grass.  This is NOT commercial grade. No restaurant would ever go through the tedium required to cut every piece of veggie or fruit to fit throught the tiny feed hole. The only exception would be skinny carrots and celery.  Even the big end of the celery will not fit without cutting.  Everything has to be pushed, to make if fully through the masticating process.  Even celery and carrots.  There is nothing about this juicer that is better then my old Juice Man.  I was super excited and thrilled to receive my new juicer and now I am now returning it because its crap for the price.  I am going back to my centrifudge juicer, its quick and easy.  The Omega is not Foam free or less foam. When juiceing the same amount of apples side by side between the Omega and Juiceman I get virtually the same amount of foam out of both types of juicers.  I am going to have to purchase a wheat grass juicer for that specific function.  The instruction manual is poor also, no hints tips or instructions on how to do anything unique like make pasta.  Maybe thats the only thing it is good for.",

I am usually technically handicapped with gadgets and couldn't believe what a breeze it is to use. the only glitch I ran into (maybe someone else did too?) is when juicing apples they turned to pulp mush. I corrected this problem by using only GRANNY SMITH APPLES which are known for crunchiness and haven't had a problem since. it wasn't the juicer,it was the quality of apple I was using that caused problem! hope this helps for any future juicers just starting out. my husband and I started 4 days ago and he went from 218lbs to 208! I went from 196 to 193. I have energy and feel much more alert. my husbands belly has dramatically shrunk! guess it is true that men lose weight quicker than women.haha. no matter, i have no doubt this is just the beginning of so may more benefits of juicing,not just losing weight,but my skin is glowing also.i highly recommend this machine.",

        "text": "This is a masticating juicer which in my opinion blows away the typical cheaper centrifugal ones.  Each has their benefits but I have yet to find any drawbacks with this juicer.  You get much more juice, drier pulp, and the juice lasts longer.  Those three things right there make it very economical and will save you money in the long run.  Also this is much more versatile than a standard juicer as you can make nut butters and much more with it.",

I can cut my green apples into eighths instead of fourths so they'll fit in the feed tube.  It takes a few seconds.  I can blend soft fruits.  There have been no issues with  reliability so far.\nI see Omega has a newer model with a larger tube and tension knob at the end.

But ok, I can cut things small enough, it just takes a lot of time. Also, with apples and pineapple, in particular (which I use a lot of), it gets stuck in the tube and can't get out. So oftentimes I have to stop, rinse it off and continue, which is a real pain. Don't know if that's normal or not. I wash it thoroughly with the scrub brush every time, so that's not the issue.

The ONLY issue I have had with this one is with juicing pineapple.  it was &#34;clogging&#34; the juicer but I have found if I cut the pineapple in small pieces and then run a couple pieces of carrot or something harder through it every time it starts to clog, the carrot cleans it right out.  I put Wheat Grass through it, spinach, kale, all sorts of fruits and veggies with no problems.  Just follow anything soft (Strawberries, kiwi, mango, etc) with something harder to clean it out.  Love this juicer and would recommend it to anyone!!",

        "text": "I've been researching juicers for over a month trying to decide on which one to purchase.  I was torn between the omega 8006 and the Kuvings whole slow juicer. The Omega 8006 did not disappoint & fills all my desires in a juicer.  I haven't tried to make pasta or nut butter yet but juicing both greens and fruits is becoming so addictive with the ease of the Omega 8006. Clean up is no less than 3 minutes!! No lie!! Which was another major factor I wanted in a juicer, not a lot of pieces to scrub and stay at the sink all day with. Prep time does take a little longer being that the feeding chute is about an inch, inch and a 1/2 but I enjoy it!! Ive juiced cilantro, parsley, spinach, kale, beets,pineapples,apples, oranges, & carrots! This machine loves carrots!! I've juiced All with no problem. With the apples it does create a bit of um...not foam but a baby food texture which the kids and I put in a separate bowl and added a little cinnamon which tastes way better than the store brought motts applesauce!! I LOVE THIS JUICER!!!!!. I wouldn't consider it a problem, but In case you get a little backup which I did with the pineapples, just hit the reverse button and switch the machine back into the on position.  The reason why it backs up this way Is because of the texture of the pineapples.( I think)  I'm still curious as to how the Kuvings does with fruit and vegetables. This machine does fine with fruit but seems to love greens and vegetables more so I'm thinking of purchasing the Kuvings still just to do a side by side comparison.  If I do I'll write another review. I guess because I was torn between the kuvings and the omega curiosity is still on my mindas to how thekuvongs actually works. Today makes 5 days that I've been using the Omega 8006. So my review is based on the few days I've used it as well as the numerous you tube videos I've watched. There's more than plenty of video reviews on you tube that you can watch to get a visual idea of the blender and its performance.  Oh! A Iot of people talk about the quietness of the juicer, it it very quiet, enough so that I can juice while my husband and the kids are sleep if I wake in the middle of the night and want some fresh juice but it does have a slight low hum. But very low. No one's review really talks much about storing your juice.the best and healthiest thing is to not store your juice, drink it as soon as you juice. If you're juicing and taking it to work for lunch or something like that I would think that that's fine but it's not like store bought juice with added preservatives where it can last for a weekin thof fridge, so the longer you leave it in the fridge it looses it nutrients. After doing research the only thing I've found that is recommended is no more than 3 days in a glass jar or storage container with a tight air sealed cap. Mason jars are great. Or you can look on Amazon or Google jars for  juicing. The Omega 8006 is very small. But heavy & very sturdy. I know this was a long review but it's honest and I had to put in everything that came to mind so that if another buyer is considering buying the Omega 8006 their questions will be answered. The information I gave in the review is also questions I was looking for before I purchased it. I love it, my family loves it and I would never consider returning it. I love that it comes with a 15 year warranty and the juicing components are BPA free!! So if you buy the omega 8006 juice away and have fun!! It's very enjoyable for the whole family and very addictive. I hope this review helps and Im willing to answer any questions you may have regarding the Omega 8006! ENJOY.",

Plan on spending time cutting and slicing.  A food processor also comes in handy for pre-chopping your fruits and veggies.  It is a little slow in &#34;eating&#34; the food and you must use the plunger constantly it seems, and I've used a few juicers over the years.  You can't just stuff and walk-away. Also it's not one you'd use to make a quick fix mid-day after a run.  It is quiet as far as food processors/juicers go.  Think of a mixer on low-medium setting.  It is easy to clean, just one twist uncouples the unit from the base in one piece that you can carry to the sink and quickly disassemble the rest of it.  It washes up nicely.  It may say dishwasher safe, but If you care about the rubber seals I strongly would be against using the dishwasher.  I just use hot water and spray off the parts.  I would recommend this to a friend.  I was going to give 3 stars, but the ease of cleaning added a star.",

        "text": "Our family loves fresh juice.  This machine is great for juicing hard fruits and most vegetables.  Where it disappoints is in juicing soft or overripe fruits and veggies.\nI can juice kale, carrots, apples, etc. with no problems (provided that you do the somewhat considerable prep work to get them into the right size to feed into the narrow feed tube).  But if I try to juice a banana or mango, it backs up, clogs and simply won't juice them.  I have to dismantle the whole thing, rinse it out and start over with different ingredients.  Depending on how many soft items you have, you can put them in between very hard things and get them to juice.  (In other words, rather than juice all the celery first and then try to do the oranges next, alternate a few pieces of orange between the celery sticks.)  But if you want to make banana mango juice, that's not going to work.  (I have heard others say it might work if you refrigerate or partially freeze them, but that's not practical.)\nCompared to the Breville Juice Fountain, there are pros and cons.  The Breville is very noisy and produces a ton of foam.  The Omega is quiet and produces very little foam.  The Breville will juice soft fruits and the Omega won't.  The Breville struggles with leafy greens and the Omega doesn't.  The Omega can make baby food, pasta, butters, and more and the Breville can't.\nIf you don't plan on juicing a lot of mushy foods, I would opt for the Omega.",

        "text": "My Juiceman II needed replacing so I looked for a juicer that would give me more juice.  This is it!!  Haven't tried the nut butter or pasta part yet.  It does take a little longer, but the slower speed keeps all the nutrients.  The pomegranate juice is AMAZING.  I can't believe how quiet this is.  My juiceman sounded like it was leaving the runway.  The pulp is very dry and I am using less fruits and veggies to get more juice.",

So when getting produce make sure especially fruits that they are not soft or over ripe. Other than that the best investment in your health ever.",

It's a solidly built machine, and you can tell it will last for years.

        "text": "I juice 16 oz every day for lunch.  Typical \"green juice\":  kale, romaine, celery, carrots, cucumber, ginger for the core ingredients -- mix it up with beets, broccoli, and other greens.\nI started with the Breville 510.  Very nice centrifugal juicer.  It is easy to put together.  Juicing is a breeze with the 3 inch feed tube -- you can put a whole apple or beet down the tube.  Cleanup is easy as all the parts are large and easy to clean with a sponge (except the filter which requires a brush).  20 minutes from start to finish, including (a) assemble juicer, (b) clean and prepare vegetables, (c) juicing, and (d) cleanup.  I drink the juice while I clean up.\nHappy camper.  Then I keep researching and I keep running into web sites promoting masticating juicers over centrifugal juicers.  OK, I bit on the hype.  I wanted to minimize cleanup so I selected a single auger over the twin gears.\nI purchased the Omega J8006.\nPros:  It gets more juice from the ingredients.  The juice is noticeably tastier but not extraordinarily so.  The juice has more pulp in it.\nCons:  If I didn't have the Breville for comparison, I would also say it is easy to put together (which is easy) and clean (which isn't as easy).  You have to cut the vegetables much smaller pieces to fit into the 1 inch feeding tube -- so prep time is longer.  Getting leafy items like kale down the tube is a pain and you have a lot more chunks to put into the tube -- so juicing is longer.  The parts are smaller and there are more of them -- so cleanup takes longer.  Overall, it takes 30 minutes or longer to do what I did with the Breville in 20 minutes.  The juice and pulp containers fill easily.  If my wife also wants a glass, I have to empty both to make the second glass.\nI continue to use the Omega since, for me, the pros outweigh the extra 10 minutes to prepare lunch.  If I was juicing more often, or for more people, or smaller quantities, I would use the Breville for the faster processing and easier cleanup.\nThere is no question that centrifugal juicers (the Breville) oxidize the juice so you must consume it quickly (within 15 minutes or so) or start losing nutrients.  This is not an issue for me since I consume it immediately.  Some claim masticating (the Omega) will allow the juice to be stored for up to 24 hours.  Omega claims no foaming -- mine does foam but less than the Breville.  Both units are quiet.\nFor you new juicers:\nHang in there.  At first, for me, I could barely drink \"green juice\" without retching.  Horrible stuff.  But it does get better and then tolerable.  The benefits are worth it.  Start by adding apples and lemons (w/o rind) and removing the stems from items like kale and the skin from the cucumber.  Do research and avoid bitter items like mustard greens.  Add them in later in small doses and increase as your tolerance allows.  Start \"sweeter\" and then go for the nutrients -- but go green, don't exclude the dark green items.",

I did alot of research before purchasing mine and the reviews were very helpful.  So, now I want to help others!  The Omega 8006 is extremely efficient and for the price it is a very good choice.  You could buy the GreenStar which is more, however, the Omega 8006 does almost as well and costs alot less.  My husband and I juice every morning and it is awesome.  Juicing of course takes a little bit of time to cut the vegetables up but you are well worth the time!  Clean up is very quick and easy and the health benefit is HUGE.  We also do the fruit where you freeze it and put it through your juicer using the blank attachment.  That is awesome.  It's like eating ice cream and all you are eating is fruit.  Any fruit you want just freeze it in the size that is ready to be put through your juicer that way you have no cutting when its time.  Take it out of the freezer and use it right away.  Then what I do to mix it up and make it creamy is put it all in a bowl and just a little milk to make it easier to use a small mixer.  Add milk until it is easy to mix.  There ya go.  That's it ENJOY.  Such a healthy snack.  YUM, seriously.  We should all eat this way and skip the frozen desserts who knows what they add to it before it gets into our freezer.  This is a great juicer and I give it 5 stars totally pleased and I hope this review as helped you.  Oh, and one more thing get the chrome.  It is well worth just a few extra dollars.  It looks very nice on my counter!",

Then, I realized you could get a juicer, pasta maker, butter maker and sorbet maker in one. I like the idea to save counter space. I really wanted to make my own peanut butter. So I returned the vert juicer and purchased this one. It's great! Makes really good nut butters (my favorite is peatnut cashew butter with a little honey and olive oil). Nut butter couldn't be easier to make. You open a bag of dry roasted peanuts and drop them in. Out comes dry peanut butter. You need to add a little oil to make moist and honey is good too! As for juice it makes juice like the large pours on the vert basket, thick pulp. It comes with a strainer to strain the juice after it has been collected to remove excess pulp. Still great juice just more time consuming. If you just want juice out of your machine the vert is faster and makes high pulp or low pulp pending the basket you use and no straining necessary. If you want a machine to use for all different kinds of things this is the machine for you (still makes great juice just more time consuming to get the same juice you would get out of the vert). I'm glad I switch to this juicer from vert but if you only want great juice I would recommend the vert. Hope this helps.",

        "text": "First, the juicer arrived in a large box where it was allowed to toss and turn.  Inevitably, the product arrived with the \"FRAGILE, this side up\", completely upside down.  However, after opening the product and investigating the pieces, all seemed in order.  I also ran the device without anything in it, given the recent reviews about ground-up plastic pieces and it seems to be true to some extent, there is definitely some plastic grinding away...  However, if you investigate it, it doesn't seem to be enough to be of concern and will likely just grind itself down to a workable level.  Thus, I suggest running it without anything and washing it to check this.  Mine seems to have ground down enough to be usable.\nPackaging/seemingly minor plastic issue aside, I am impressed with this juicer.  Note that I got it only for greens as I put sweet things like beets, carrots, and apples in my VitaMix because I find those whole products with their pulp delicious.  The same cannot be said for kale, dandelion leaves, chard, cabbage, etc...  Hence, where this juicer comes in handy!\nThis juicer does exactly what I expected and provides a nice pulp-free, nutritious green juice.  I have also put ginger, turmeric, and lemons in it and it does a great job.\nI'll likely monitor the plastic issue and send it in to be fixed if necessary, given that it does have a 15 year warranty; I'm not too worried about it.",

        "text": "My previous juicer was REALLY old.  It was one of the early series of Juiceman juicers from over 10 years ago.  It was also a hand-me-down.  But I really wanted to juice, and I didn't have the budget to buy a new one, so this old one was a whole lot better than nothing.  But it also went through A TON of fruit and vegetables to get just 1 cup of juice.  And the pulp would be so wet, I could have probably hand squeezed another 1/4 cup of juice from the pulp.\nI realized I was wasting so much money by throwing pounds of fresh produce into the old Juiceman, that I could probably justify getting a new juicer.  After a couple of weeks of researching and reading tons of reviews, I landed on the Omega J8006 Masticating Juicer.  I've had it for about a month now, and I could not be happier.\nI &lt;3 the Omega Masticating Juicer because:\n- it's so much quieter that the centrifugal juicer, and I like to watch the fruit getting smooshed in the turning gears\n- the parts are very easy to clean, once you figure out how to put it together and take it apart\n- The chrome, black, and smoky clear plastic not only look good, but they are great colors/materials to resist the inevitable staining that comes from juicing things that are rich in color (and nutrients)\n- the pulp comes out very dry - to the point that i can grab it, throw it in the chicken coup, and brush the little pieces easily off my hands (without needing to dry my hands with a towel\n-gets juice out of greens and roots WAY better than centrifugal (chard, kale, beets - no problem)\nThe only thing I liked better about the centrifugal was that I could throw bigger & more pieces of produce down the chute at one time, thus saving some time in cutting & juicing.  HOWEVER, it really doesn't take that much longer, since I save time in cleaning and I don't mind being a little more patient for juice that's so yummy.",

        "text": "My Omega 8006 Juicer is one of two large juicers that I own.  The other is a Breville Juice Fountain Elite, which I purchased also from Amazon.  Each has advantages and disadvantages.  Since purchasing the Omega, it has become the juicer that I use most often because I make two days' worth of juice every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.  Due to the slow rotation (80 RPM) of the Omega's auger, the juice is less oxidized than with the extremely fast rotation of the Breville's blades (13,000 RPM).  Less oxidation means that the juice retains its taste and vitamins better, and this is important when making juice for two days at a time.  I believe that the juice from the Omega is also slightly tastier as a result of the slow rotation.\nOn the other hand, the Breville makes juice far more rapidly than the Omega.  It will juice a whole, medium-size apple; and I can juice a whole cucumber or three or four small carrots at once.  With the Omega, large carrots and all apples and cucumbers have to be sliced before inserting them into its chute.  As a result, the juicing process from start to finish probably takes three to five times as long with the Omega compared to the Breville.  As somewhat of a compensating factor, however, the Omega is much easier to clean than the Breville.\nIn sum, for making juice for two days at a time, I definitely prefer the Omega.  Its slower speed, in my opinion, is more than compensated by the fact that the juice is better for 24-hour storage, tastes slightly better, and the fact that the machine is easier to clean.  On Sundays, however, which is my busiest day of the week, I still use my Breville.  On Sundays because of time constraints, I usually juice three pounds of baby carrots for immediate consumption instead of storing the juice overnight.  With the Breville, I can juice all of those carrots and drink the juice in about the same time it would take just to make the juice with the Omega.  Bottom line:  I love both juicers with my favorite being the Omega.",

        "text": "I bought this juicer on Oct 5th 2012 and I love it!  It is so easy to clean, really easy to use and super quiet. (when I put in a celery or carrot stalk the crunching of the vegetables is louder then the machine) I have been wanting this juicer for about a year now but I was researching and comparing and frankly didn't want to fork over the $300 unless it was going to be worth it.  I finally settled on the Omega 8006 and it seriously it the best juicer I have owned or used.  I have juiced leafy greens ( Kale, Cilantro, Spinach, Wheat grass), Citrus fruits, Pineapple, Cranberries you name it.  I have not had any problems with any of it.  I did notice when doing softer fruit/Vegetables like Pears/Cucumbers that the Auger chamber gets filled with pulpy liquid but as long as you follow the directions and follow it with a harder fruit/vegetable (Carrot, Celery, even Kale) it pushes the pulp and liquid right through and into the juicer container below.\nSome of the reviews I read on here said that they had problems with the Auger getting chipped or leaving a plastic residue on the screen from parts rubbing/grinding inside the chamber.  Obviously this made me a little skeptical about purchasing the juicer.  I am happy to say that I have not experienced this and have been using my juicer several times a day for various soft and hard produce with no problems.  This new version the 8006 has a 15 year warranty and I did notice that it says on the box \"8 times stronger\"  So I can only guess maybe the past problems of chipping was just a bad batch and its has been corrected by the company with this new model or with latest production.\nThis machine can also be used for making frozen sorbet from fruit as well as pasta and baby food.  I can not comment on these functions as of yet as I have only used it for juicing but I am excited to try it out and see how it works.\nOn a side not just s few things to keep in mind.  Yes, you do have to cut fruit so that it fits in the 50 Cent piece sized hole usually not a problem with celery, carrots etc, Apples and such need to be sliced. The machine is not supposed to be run for longer then 30 min continuously, I glance at the clock before I start and it seriously only takes about 10-15 with minutes to make enough juice for the entire day.  I usually juice in the morning or the night before and make enough to last the whole day.  Since this is a slow speed masticating juicer the juice you make will last up to two days (48 hours)in the refrigerator.  The expelled pulp is really dry and it can be frozen for up to three months and is great for baking (Carrot Cake/ Cran/orange muffins) or making a soup/stew broth.\nHope this helps you make a decision,\nCheers and Happy Juicing :)",

        "text": "So, first, my suggestions for what you should think about before you even put this in your cart if you're someone who's a) super busy with a crazy work schedule and b) on a tight tight budget\n1. make sure you are *really* into juicing before you buy this. I bought pre-packaged, raw, juice for *months* to make sure I was all in with this juicing thing. When i finally became psychologically dependent on raw green juice, then and only then did I decide that it was worth @ $230.00 to buy this appliance to make my own.\n2. understand that juicing takes *time*. I'm too cheap (er, frugal) to buy organic produce, so I have to a. wash & soak produce for minutes in a vinegar/water solution, b. peel produce, c. chop produce into small (yes, small) pieces, d. then, move on to the juicer. It's not a quick breakfast by any stretch.\n3. commit to immediately washing and/or soaking the juicer pieces after use. you don't want to mess with caked on stuff.\nI think those are all my cautions. Now for a review of its performance and such:\n1. it's pretty; looks nice on my counter. I leave it out all the time.\n2. It's quiet. much quieter than my regular blender\n3. clean up is actually quite easy- just soak, rinse, scrub the grate a little, then let air dry.\n4. *but* it gives you a pulpy juice if you're juicing like spinach or kale (why?????).  I didn't get pulp when I was juicing just cucumbers and apples and such. This is my biggest complaint actually. Because after I go through the *whole* process of juicing, then I have to use a wire strainer with my juice *before* i get to drink it. booooooo. that's why i give this 3 stars. otherwise, it'd be a four or five star thing. but who wants to drink spinach mango cucumber juice (yum!) and have to pause to spit out green pulp? not me.",

I bought a centrifugal juicer at first but returned it before opening for a masticating juicer because of all the positive reviews towards the masticating juicers.  I have only had this juicer one week but I am absolutely thrilled.  Not only was it smaller than I expected so it sits on my counter top like a toaster (I keep the nozzle and juice/pulp collecting containers in a drawer) but it's so beautiful!  However, BEST PART is how EASY it is to use!  And the clean-up is a BREEZE.  The parts, once you learn how to assemble and disassemble them, are really easy to clean.  The pulp collects very dry and cleanly in one of the two plastic bins for easy dumping or composting.  The juicer seems very efficient as again, the pulp emitted is very dry and can be touched and played with.  The chute is very small, yes, but I find that you'd probably cut up your veggies no matter what juicer you have and it doesn't bother me one bit to chop my fruits and vegetables.  They only need a very quick rough chop and it takes no time at all.  I am extremely happy with my new baby.  It is also VERY VERY quiet in my opinion.  It is quieter than a blender.  I can watch TV and juice at the same time.  I can't believe I didn't know how easy juicing can be!  If you use it daily, a thorough rinse on most days should suffice and a deep clean maybe once a week.  This, in my opinion, is definitely an every-day juicer's juicer.  LOOOVVVEEEE!!!!\nALSO!  It apparently makes nut butters and pasta and it seems to say it can even grind meat!!!  How exciting!  A really neat all-in-one gourmet machine.  I can't wait to try making my own almond butter and spaghetti!  Highly recommended.  Don't try and skimp and save $100 when you're already spending a good amount of money, save a little longer and buy this machine.  It's worth the extra money.  Can't say enough.",

Assuming that maybe juicers had come a long way in the last few years, I decided to try again.  I had my engineer husband read reviews of several juicers and his opinion was the Omega would be the best choice.\nI am completely delighted with this juicer!  Literally, to rinse and clean the whole thing is two minutes time.  I keep it on my counter all the time and rinse it immediately after I use it - super easy.  Another thing is I am very glad I got a masticating juicer.  It makes for a thicker, almost pulpy juice that is not foamy. If you are ever going to try a juice fast, I think you will find, as I did, that the thick juice from a masticating juicer will keep you more full than the thin juices created by cheaper juicers.  As a matter of fact, I was 6 days into a juice fast and had to go on a business trip.  I found a local juice bar there so I thought I could continue my fast.  But their juicer created thin, watery juices that left me starving, so I had to break my fast until I returned home.\nJuicing in general is a bit of work.  You need to wash and chop all those fruits and veggies - it is a whole different level of effort than, say, having a bowl of cereal.  So anything that makes it easier and creates a better product is worth paying a little more for, imo.  I feel the Omega was well worth the price and will surely be using it for years to come.",

I read somewhere before that I should feed the wheatgrass in with the tips first, so I've been doing that.  But from talking to a store owner who has experience, I guess the best way is the bunch up the wheatgrass so that it doesn't go in straight.  Not what I did.  I fed it in lengthwise and today it cracked the juicing screen.  Now it won't work.\nMy fault?  totally.\nI go right on Amazon to buy myself a replacement screen.

So now I have to buy a $75 overpriced replacement, or get on someone's backorder list.  Or buy a new juicer.  I guess the Samsun Advanced doesn't have this screen, and is made in the same factory.

        "text": "March 26, 2012:\nI have had this for 2 wks now. I bought it because my daughter's health is compromised and as she starts to heal, I want to nourish her with the best possible foods I can get into her. And I wanted my whole family to benefit from juicing as well.\nI first ordered the $99 Breville like everybody sees in the movie Fat Sick & Nearly Dead. I sent it back because it was so loud and the pulp was so wet, the amount of wasted juice was upsetting. Clean up was not easy, the screen was impossible to really clean. I decided it would be worth it to upgrade. I also wanted to get into juicing greens, and from what I gather, a centrifugal juicer just wouldn't work as well.\n(Side note: within 2 days of my ordering the Breville it went up about $50! What?!)\nIt arrived on time, well packed. It is a hefty piece of machinery, but like others said - the 'chrome' is plastic. But whatever.\nThe auger is a heavy duty plastic. The pieces that come with it seemed very sturdy.\nFor the record, I am a mom that is willing to clean & cut up produce as necessary. I do not care if I have to make pieces small enough to fit. I clean & cut up produce ahead of time so I can grab stuff & juice when I want.\nThe motor was so much more quiet than the Breville. It seemed to munch through produce & greens well. The pulp was SO much more drier than the Breville. This I was pleased with. It was no biggie to clean up afterwards. Screen cleans easily with the big toothbrush scrub brush they provide.\nSO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? You cannot even juice one apple without it getting clogged up. Now I know from reading reviews, watching You Tube videos and from practice that it is best to follow some softer fruit with something hard like a carrot piece or a cut up beet piece to push through the pulp. You need to use fresh (not mushy or old) produce.  I shop every other day for my produce. My apples (granny smith) are crisp & fresh as is everything else. My kids say - we would like some fresh apple juice, no carrot this time please. Sorry, no can do. As soon as I get halfway through as apple, pulp and juice start to back up inside. I see some pieces of apple that won't even snake through to the end of the auger. So I will say ok kids let me stick one piece of carrot through just to get things moving - stuff still gets backed up. I tried to do 3 apples, I had to clean the whole thing out 3 times to do so. That is not going to cut it with a $300 juicer.\n(I cut up my apples in slices and do not use the core/seeded sections)\nTHEN I notice this starts happening with every juice I make. Any fruit veggie combo. Hard & soft stuff: just carrots, carrot apple beet; kale celery apple, whatever - much of it is pulping up inside, clogging up the inner screen, and not coming out. Some juice comes out, but when you open it up to clean it, it is like juicy baby food inside, as well as pieces of produce not juiced at all. I started keeping track - I can make about 4 oz of juice before it starts to clog up & work inefficiently.\nI contacted Omega last week and got customer service on the phone pretty easy. They asked - how long have you owned it? A week. Are you using fresh produce? Yes. Are you using the screen not the blank? Yes, using the screen. Probably you need a new auger. They said they would send me one right away.\nSO - let's see how long it takes them to get the new auger to me, and let's hope it works. I sure hope that is all it is because I really really want to like this juicer. I will update as soon as I have a verdict.\nUPDATE MARCH 27, 2012\nFirst off, let me thank Omega customer service for getting the new auger to me so quickly. It arrived this morning, about a week after we spoke. It is a different color than the original but that is OK.\nI cleaned it up & tried it out right away. Same problem. Juice & pulp gets clogged up inside, produce pieces are going un-pulverized and just spinning in the auger as it turns,not coming out even when I put in beets or carrots. I am disappointed and will be returning this. I am bummed because I had high hopes for this juicer, noting all the positive reviews. I am a big researcher of products before I buy, esp with high price items.\nIf anyone has a suggestion for a better juicer please let me know!",

        "text": "I got rid of a centrifugal juicer to buy this, because I wanted a masticating one.  I am VERY happy with my purchase.  The leftover pulp is nearly dry, so it's obviously extracting almost everything from the fruits and veggies.\nThere are two things I miss about my old Breville centrifugal juicer though:\n1.  It was so much faster!  With the Breville, I could have a whole pitcher of juice extracted within seconds, as long as the fruit was washed first.  The Omega juices more slowly because it \"chews\" the food instead of spinning.  Which i know is a good thing, just takes some getting used to.\n2.  The feeder tube was huge; I could fit whole pears through it.  The chute on the Omega is so much smaller, so I have to cut the fruits into much smaller pieces...which takes a lot more time.  I understand that it needs to be, so the chunks fit between the \"teeth\", but it's still annoying that it takes so much more prep.\nAll in all though, I am thrilled with my purchase.  It makes excellent juices, which can be stored for small periods of time.  I highly recommend this juicer!",

This replaced an old black & decker centrifugal juicer that though worked well with soft fruits and veggies, did not yield much juice especially with the leafy greens. I must say the Omega 8006 is truly a beautiful appliance. I love the way I can actually juice in the morning without waking everyone else up. Set up, juice and clean in 30 minutes and I had 3 servings for my day. I know the price is sort of scary, and it took me a little while to take the hit to the wallet, but boy am I glad I did. Very impressed with the juicer so far!",

It easily juices anything I throw it's way, and it does so continuously.  I never have to stop juicing because the filter is getting plugged up (like I've had to do with other juicer).  The great thing about this omega juicer is that it is VERY easy to clean after use.  The parts come apart easily, and I can just throw them in the top rack of the dish washer.  The Omega Juicer is also a great value because it does a lot of different things.  It acts like a Yonanan if you want to make frozen fruits into desserts (but far more effectively).  It also makes nut butter, grinds meat, grinds coffee beans, and processes wheat or barely grass.  Not to mention, it can make pasta (if you're into that).  This thing is awesome! Plus it has a 15 year warranty!  Not many products offer that kind of guarantee!",

        "text": "I will first say that this is my first juicer, but I did thorough research before spending $200+ (as everyone should) and it has certainly paid off. I have had no issues so far and use this juicer daily, often two to three times. It lives up to its claim of squeezing every nutrient out of fruit and vegetables and leaving dry pulp behind in a separate, easy-to-empty container. The main juicing compartment is clear, and I enjoy watching the process of the auger grinding fruits and vegetables into juice. This is truly an investment in your health. Omega offers a 15-year warranty for this product. The one &#34;complaint&#34; I have (which is honestly a non-issue for me, but I could foresee being an inconvenience for others, based on the reviews I read prior) is that the feeding tube is a bit small, about large enough to fit one orange &#34;slice&#34;. You really do have to chop vegetables into small enough sizes to comfortably fit through the tube, otherwise they (mostly carrots, I've found) will get stuck, and you'll have to shove a knife down the tube to try and un-jam them. This is, in my opinion, a small price to pay for a well-built, quality juicer that will last years and transform your life.\nOne feature I particularly love is that the juicer comes with a sieve that filters out any foam, and fits both interchangeable containers - one used for juice, and the other for pulp. I have found this feature to be a necessity, after having seen juicers with one pour spout (the Breville BJE820XL, popular among Joe Cross/Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead fans, for example). Fruit and vegetables produce a lot of foam, particularly apples, and a sieve catches 90 percent of it.\nClean up is easy, and I often stand in the kitchen, sip my juice, and clean the juicer. Making it a multi-task effort really reduces the feeling of inconvenience of having to clean up. The entire experience is a joy, especially knowing I am doing something so healthy for myself. I absolutely recommend the Omega J8006 if you are in the market for a juicer.",

        "text": "I purchased Omega J8006 Juicer on December 15, 2011, and I have been using it every single day since then. The following is the list of produce I use on a daily basis for my juice:\nApples\nPears\nOranges\nGrapefruits\nGinger Root\nCarrots\nBeets\nGreen/Red Pepper\nKale\nSwiss Chard\nCilantro\nCelery\nSpinach\nLemon\nLime\nParsley\nPumpkins\nBlueberries\nPineapple\nTomatoes\nGrapes\nCucumbers\nPeaches\nStrawberries\nMint leaves\nCranberries, etc.\nThe combinations per my morning juice differ, however many of the fruits and vegetables remain pretty standard.\nIn the past, I purchased from Bed Bath and Beyond a standard centrifugal type juicer for $150+ dollars. Unfortunately, the engine burned out within first month. I tried a few other juicers, but the same problems persisted:\n1. The juicer would not do a good job on leafy greens (mint leaves, Swiss Chard, Kale, etc.)\n2. The juicer would oxidize the juice which dramatically shortened the life span of the produced juice\n3. The left overs from the production of the juice still contained about 50% of the juice.\n4. Difficult to clean.\nThe Omega J8006 Juicer fixed all the problems. The juicer does a very good job on leafy greens. It does not oxidize the juice due to its juice extraction construction design, and the left overs are completely dry. It is ease to clean (it takes me about 1.5 - 2 min to wash the parts).\nNow, I used this juicer 30-40 min daily since the day I received it.\nThe following is the list of items I found annoying:\n1. The produce feeding opening is too small for my liking. I have to cut apples and other items into small pieces before feeding them in.\n2. If you put soft fruits into the juicer you will get jam instead of juice.\n3. Warranty Support is not very good. On October 2, 2012 the juicing screen with plastic mesh broke from continuous use. It took me 3 weeks to get the replacement. The Warranty department kept telling me that the part is out of stock and it should arrive shortly. They kept telling me this for 3 weeks in a row until I started yelling and demanding to speak to the manager. At which point they found the replacement part and shipped it to me within 5 business days.\nNow, I love this juicer. I got used to the fact that the feeding opening is smaller then other juicers (it still sometimes annoys me). I was able to get the juice from the soft fruits by interchangeably feeding a bit of soft produce followed by the hard one (like carrots, beets, etc.).\nSo, the only problem i have with this machine is the warranty department. I do not know if my experience with their warranty department is standard or an extraneous one.\nI would definitely recommend this product for anyone. I found it to be very good except for the warranty part.",

Carrot , beet,\nand other vegetables, the produced pulp is bone dry. This means that you are getting all the nutriments into your juice. The juices taste great and as an extra bonus cleanup is a breeze. Juicing wheatgrass is an art. You have to find out the right amount to put into the machine to yield the best results. I find if I pass the wheatgrass pulp through the machine a second time, I get more juice and drier pulp. With the cheaper machines you cannot put the pulp through a second pass The machines don't have the power to press out\nthe extra juice! .This machine does so much more than juice. After my diet is over in about 4 months I plan to try the pasta attachment. Nope think I'll wait 'till the Holidays to make the pasta and deserts with this juicer. At which time I'll update this review.\nFor now, I am feeling stronger and healthier due to adding wheatgrass and other vegetable juices.",

I happened to find this model on sale and went for it and so far this thing crushes all the vegetables I've thrown at it to pieces.  I'm not sure about other reviews talking about pieces breaking with the auger or other parts failing but so far this thing is solid!  I'm not sure if they're following recommended usage as the instructions clearly state that you should cut some of your vegetables into smaller pieces.  Of course, I do this with parsnips, carrots, beets or anything that's more of a root vegetable or basically any hard vegetable.  Leafy vegetables you can somewhat throw in as is although you probably should chop it into slightly smaller pieces.  Will catch pretty much all of the pulp and even comes with a small strainer that you can place over the bowl that catches the juice.  Highly recommended machine if you're thinking about juicing instead of blending vegetable smoothies.",

Well, I ran this product for several minutes dribbling the slightest bit of water through it the entire time so I would have a clear substance to see any plastic shavings in.  According to some reviewers, after calling Omega to complain about the auger rubbing and producing plastic shavings they were informed that the machine should not be run dry.  Hence my use of water to make sure mine wasn't going to have this problem.  There was not a speck of plastic shavings produced during several minutes of its first run.\n  I made juice shortly after and it turned out very well.  This is the very first juicer I have ever owned so I have only customer reviews to compare others to.  I love it.  The only thing that was a little annoying was having to cut all the produce up into smallish pieces but that's only a slight inconvenience.  Cleaning it took just a couple of minutes; far less time than it took to prep the produce.\n  I'm happy with it.  I think it's worth the risk of potentially bad customer service you may get from Omega should you have to contact them and the whole (blown out of proportion) scare of the auger rub producing plastic shavings.",

        "text": "This review is from my j8005 review and a bit modified\nSo i ordered this (j8005) during the Amazon special and altho there is much difference between the j8004/j8005/j8006 it both does its job the same way. With a few minor cosmetic looks on each machine and the most important part.. the auger on the j8006.\nMy first machine was the j8005.. When i start masticating soft veggies such as spinach, kales leaves, and other leafy greens, juice gets stuck inside the tube area where its suppose to be pushed out. After reading numerous reviews and forums about the j8005, it seems the issue has to do with the Auger. The Auger was made of different material from the j8004/j8006. The j8006 auger seems to be made of more sturdy material and less toxic which is an issue in the j8005 machine.\nAltho the units all function the same way.. a simple issue such as the auger made a huge difference in how juice came out. I partically didnt like how wet pulp was always stuck to the auger on the j8005 and it always caused a MESSY clean up and loss of product effectiveness. If you do get a good deal on this, do yourself a favor and replace the auger on this thru omegajuicer.com.. unfortunately, it cots $60 to replace it.\nNow after making a few weeks of fresh juice, the unit is still functioning well after putting in kale, spinach, carrots, apples, pears, cabbage, cuccumbers, etc etc. The Pulp doesnt stick to the auger and comes right out into the disposable dish. The pulp is quite dry when it comes out with the exception of fruits such as apple and pears.. I usually run those in twice to extract maximum juice. Great model! Cant go wrong with either j8004 or j8006",

        "text": "I got this juicer for my wife for Christmas after reading many reviews and doing a lot of comparison to centrifugal juicers.  I came to the conclusion that masticating juicers would be better for us since we want to juice a lot of greens.  I also read that this type of juicer tends to get around 20% more juice from your produce.  This machine did not disappoint.\nFirst off, the machine itself is sturdy and VERY easy to assemble/disassemble.  Cleaning is a snap and only takes a few minutes.\nSecond, it makes a lot of juice.  I'm talking a stream of juice from fresh fruits and veggies.  If, like us, you've never juiced until buying this machine, you'll be amazed at just how much juice can be squeezed out of a seemingly &#34;dry&#34; veggie like kale, and fruits like lemon and oranges produce a small river!  Ginger also produces a bountiful stream of juice, which is something to keep in mind considering how strong a flavor it is!  The pulp that comes out of this juicer is pretty dry in general, with soft, juicy veggies like cucumber and fruits like the aforementioned lemons and oranges producing a more moist pulp.\nOk, so what's the bad side?  Not much, and it's even less when you look at it from the proper perspective.  The only even slight negative I can come up with so far is that the chute for loading your soon-to-be-juiced items is fairly small, as others have mentioned.  This isn't truly a negative though, since it is highly recommended that you cut the fruits and vegetables you're going to juice into smaller pieces anyway; this tends to get more juice, and more nutrition, out of your produce, and it makes it easier on the juicer!  So, as I said earlier, if you look at it from that perspective, it's not even a negative!\nThis is a great machine, and though it is not cheap, it's a quality machine with a 15-year warranty that does a spectacular job of extracting juice.",

I had a $50 Juiceman that made everything taste burnt and I had to try putting veggies through a second time to get more juice. This extracts great-tasting juice and leaves such dry leftovers that there's no sense in trying to run them through a second time. The motor grinds through anything and acts like I could shove a motor block through the feeder with no problem. Clean up is so much easier too! All 5 parts rinse clean, with only an itty-bitty screen to scrub. If you want to get serious about making your own fresh fruit and vegetable (including/especially kale & wheat grass) you NEED this machine!",

        "text": "I make half a gallon of vegetable juice in the morning with my Omega juicer, keep it cold so that enzymes would stay alive and drink a glass of it every hour or so throughout the day. This daily routine is possible only with the Omega because centrifuge juicers make too much noise for the morning and also oxidize juice during the juicing process, allegedly keeping enzymes alive only for 20 minutes after it is made.\nEven prior to purchasing the Omega, I was drinking as much juice as I am now. However, due to the 20 minute restriction, I had to drink freshly-made juice all at once, rushing me to the bathroom for diarrhea. With the Omega juicer, I can enjoy my juice little by little as long as it stays cold, thanks to its masticating extraction method.\nOne thing that prospective buyers should keep in mind is that this juicer requires special attention to clean properly. My Omega juicer considerably deteriorated in efficiency after minerals built up on the removal parts, especially on the perforated metal parts. The removal parts need to be immersed in water with a solution of dishwasher detergent overnight to remove the mineral stains. This will do the magic.",

        "text": "I love when I research a product thoroughly before buying, feel good about my choice and then am still amazed by how much I love it once I'm using it.  This thing is such good quality and works so well.  People who say it's hard to clean must be doing the cleaning after everything has dried on.  Most everything just slips off under the water, except for the strainer part, and that's still really easy to do a quick scrub on with the included brush.  Then I toss in dishwasher (except I handwash the containers so they'll last longer, painless.)\nOther people have included really detailed info about the pros of this, and I can only add my shout to theirs.  No juicer will ever be perfect for every little thing.  If you want to do greens, a masticating juicer is a must.  And this will not damage the enzymes.  No heating.  And on mixed juices, start with a hard one (carrot, beet, etc), then keep alternating soft and hard, then end with a couple more hard, then the soft stuff will pass through easily 95% of the time.  For straight apple juice, do firm varieties or just really fresh apples in the fridge overnight.  For pineapple (yum), fridge overnight and start and end with a core piece.  Gets a little mushy, you lose a little, but not much and the juice is amazing.\nI also love how quick it all goes.  I don't mind cutting up the food some for a quality machine.  But this thing is still a power house.  Some i cut as I go.  But all in all, I can have a good mixed juice on my lips in 15 min, from the time I walk into the kitchen, incl clean up.  CLEAN UP BEFORE YOU DRINK.  :)  I did have one juice take me almost 25 min, but it was several ingredients (6 or 7?) and I was doing it with my boys.\nThis machine is so straightforward my 5 yo can put it together.  He's also made almond meal by himself.  He and his 3 yo brother love to add the fruits and veg when juicing.\nFor almond meal, run the almonds through twice, no more!  So great.  For nut butters, keep dumping them back through about 6 times for smooth.  Made almond milk by soaking almonds in a jar of water overnight, then spooned the almonds sloppily with water into the tube.  Run the fiber through a second time.  Needs straining for my taste, but was so easy I went off my homemade nutmilk strike.\nWe did the frozen banana &#34;ice cream&#34; too.  Definitely leave the bananas out for maybe 15-30 min before.  Solid frozen doesn't work.\nHaven't tried making flour yet, which I'm dying to do, but understand from a youtube video that it's not the best for that, comes out more like a cracked wheat.  Plan to try anyway and maybe send through a couple times.\nThe directions say not to put the strainer on top of the container where the juice goes, but I do it every time.  Only once was it so thick that it backed up (I juiced a banana which you really shouldn't do, but it turned out pretty great in the juice).  I just pushed my finger around on it until it went down and resumed juicing.\nIf you can't clean right away, put everything in the sink covered with water so it will be easy when you come back.\nThrilled with this purchase.",

        "text": "We wanted a juicer and so I went online and Amazon and tried to research which one would be best.  I admit I am always concerned about quality on any manufactured device these days.  We have had this juicer now for two years and it is awesome!  And it certainly has had its workout.  I bought 3 additional ones for my family members.  This machine is much more quiet than others and it does not heat up the juice because it is a masticating machine.  I have an original Juicemaster machine which is quite loud.  A couple of pointers, the inside metal/plastic strainer may need to be eventually replaced unless you are very careful to clean it with a brush after use.  The inside of the our strainer got some mineral builder up on the metal part.  Both my sister and I ended up replacing this part, but our juicers have gone with through hundreds of juicings.  Also make sure you fully turn the round black locking device clockwise which is attached to the base.  If you get some buildup of juice material on this locking mechanism you may turn it only so far and think it is locked it but it is not.  I have taken a phillips screwdriver to remove this locking mechanism and clean it up from spilled juice.  Once I do that everything works like it originally did.",

        "text": "***Review Update (21/11/10):\nI've been using this juicer everyday for over one year now, and it's still running strong. I have no idea how some other reviewer said they had their auger chipping. All of my omega 8006's parts are still in new quality after over a year of juicing daily. This auger is the strongest material I've ever seen in a juicer. You would have to juice bricks to see that chip, and I've juiced tons of the hardest vegetables without any problems with my auger.\nI've done many cleansing and juice fasting programs with my omega 8006, and it's been a life saver. It has literally been a life saver when I was extremely sick with pneumonia and had to go through surgery. I couldn't eat, but thankfully I had my family juice me fresh fruit and vegetable juices canned in jars to the hospital. To be honest I don't think they would have juiced me so many cans of juice if I had my older juicer, which took forever to clean.\nI also remember a time when I had all 4 wisdom tooth removed and I couldn't eat. I felt extremely weak and tired, but thank god my omega juicer is so easy to juice and clean, even in that state I made my own juices.\nNow for a real review of the juicer: I believe a juicer is one of the single most valuable investment one can make in their lives. With a 15 year warranty, and with such a low price compared to the super expensive \"high end\" juicers that take an hour to juice and clean, I would definitely buy this again a hundred times over. The time it takes to juice and clean varies with what you are juicing, but for me it is approximately 2-10 minutes. Every morning I start my day with an orange and apple juice with some superfood. The juicing process of my morning juice is so fast and easy, it takes about 2 minutes. I can clean and put my juicer back together in under 30 seconds. Try to do this with your $1000 juicer that juices slightly better quality greens.\nThis juicer really shines on leafy greens like kale, wheatgrass, and spinach. It also is great with carrots and beet roots. It can juice anything, but it seems to have some trouble with certain soft fruits. Though things like oranges will juice extremely well leaving a dry pulp.\nI really am still impressed at the taste and quality of my juice from this juicer. At 80 RPM's, it really saves all the vitamins, minerals and enzymes of the fruit and vegetables, and you can really see the color shine in the juice.\nI think the only reason I use this juicer daily is because the process is extremely fast. I never have a day when I am too tired to juice in the morning. I have more energy and vibrant health than ever before. I am extremely satisfied with my juicer and recommend this to everyone who is health conscious and is looking for a very good quality and efficient juicer.\n(*Old Review):\nI've been juicing daily for a while now, but unfortunately I could only afford a centrifugal juicer. My juicer was the Waring Pro, which made decent juice for the cheap price of the juicer. Though the pulp was almost always wet, and greens would always come out as chunks. Still, some juice is always better than no juice.\nI just recently received my Omega 8006, and WOW I was so glad to have done my research. It really is good as they say. The pulp is bone dry, extracts quality juice, quiet, and low rpms which saves most of the enzymes of the fruits and vegetables. The centrifugal I had ran at probably 8000 RPM's which literally kills most of the enzymes of the produce.\nAnother thing I noticed was the color and taste of the juice when juicing from the omega. I did not know orange juice is supposed to have so many flavours. From the centrifugal it just tasted like sugar water. Wow it was amazing when I tasted my first orange juice. The color was darker and brighter and it just tasted SO GOOD!\nLast thing is about clean up, I can literally take it apart, clean it, and put it back within the minute. Extremely fast clean up, nothing messy about it.\nThis is definitely worth the money for 15 years of warranty",

        "text": "The Omega 8006 juicer is a single auger style of juicer that is designed to juice slowly at 80 rpms. There is less oxidation that way. And it is slow. It also has a very small chute in which to feed the produce so you have to cut all the fruit and vegetables small enough to fit. This can take some time. One huge feature of the Omega 8006 juicer is that it is quiet. I have a VitaMix that is so loud I know my neighbor (and me) can't stand it when I'm making smoothies early in the morning.\nIt is very easy to take apart and clean. There is only one very small area that you have to scrub with a brush.\nI like the handle on the top of the unit. It is a bit big but not overly so and has not dominated my counter. I keep in the corner and it's easily pulled out when I want to use it.\nThe pulp is fairly dry so I feel I am getting most of the juice from my organic produce.\nThe juice is delicious. The only time I've not been thrilled is when I get carried away juicing things like kale and add too much. I find myself drinking juices that I would never have dreamed of drinking before like dandelion, kale, chard, cucumber, ginger, and beets. I never liked beets but find I love them in my juice!\nThe price on this unit is fair at $280. The only thing I really don't like is the fact the whole thing is made out of plastic, body, augur, etc. The tiny screen seems to be metal. But it does a pretty good job of looking like it's chrome.\nThis is called a nutrition center because you can make pasta, nut butters, etc. If and when I use those features I will post a update.\nI think some people could get a bit impatient with the time it takes to wash, chop, juice, and clean but it's time well spent. I have been drinking a tall glass of green juice every day and I feel great! Amazingly great.",

We were keen to try wheat grass and other veggies that the basket type of juicers struggle with so this juicer seemed like the obvious choice.\nWe found out after our purchase that my sister in law had also bought a juicer some time ago, it was the spinning basket type. She stopped using it after a few weeks just because of how long it took to clean.\nThe Omega 8006 can do pretty much anything, it is solidly made and clean up time is around a minute and a half!\nWe have explored many many juice recipes since getting it and also discovered that if you use toasted almonds this thing makes perfect almond butter which means during the 15 years this machine is warrantied for it will probably pay for itself when you look at the cost of buying freshly ground almond butter.\nWe are very satisfied with this juicer and would recommend it for anyone thinking of doing a juice fast or just adding more juices to their diet.",

        "text": "Although I am new to juicing and this is the very first juicer I've purchased, Its obvious this is a high quality product built to last (15 year warranty and built in Korea) After reviewing multiple juicers and reading up on this whole new field of information, I determined this juicer best met my needs and the needs of my family; mainly the fact I have a baby on the way and this will allow us to produce healthy baby foods.\nThat being said, there are both pros and cons to be mentioned. Pros: easy to clean, high quality plastic and parts, nutrition versatility (processes greens best over other juicers, processes other foods, pasta, baby food, etc.) The exterior is a chromed plastic, but well done and easily cleaned. The list is longer but that's the basics.\nCons... Well not any too significant. The complaint about the the screen being scraped is evident only slightly in mine--no chunks of plastic, but definitely some minor scraping. Here's what I think is happening- the auger is made to have some play in its axis so it gives a little when harder vegetables are put down the chute, otherwise the pressures between the auger/vegetable could possibly produce a crack in the housing. So the auger does slightly touch the screen during rotation WITHOUT vegetable matter. With the vegetables being juiced there is lubrication and pulp matter to keep the auger off and rotating more in center. So prepare to run something down it right away when starting it up dry if this concerns you.\nAlso the chute is fairly small but probably because it focuses the vegetables to come down in the right area upon the auger. So one should prepare everything chopped up to that diameter about 1 1/4 inch prior to chuting it. This also makes for slower juicing times if your doing a lot of stuff. There is benefit in that however with low oxidation and low foam.\nOther than that, it does everything I would expect it to and it makes an awesome munching sound with vegetables that gives  me laugh.\nI would definitely recommend this juicer to anyone and be a dealer if owned a store.\nHappy juicing and good health.",

        "title": "Omega compared to my Champion",
        "text": "I'm not new to juicing, but I haven't done it for several years. Time to get back into healthy habits.\nMy previous juicer was a Champion. It was a real workhorse, a fine machine, but it was ruined in a house fire. It had a few drawbacks though, so I wanted to try something else this time around. I settled on the Omega. This review will mostly be a comparison between the two.\n*Something negative about the Champion is the noise. It was so loud I worried it was damaging my hearing--seriously. The Omega's quiet operation is a nice surprise.\n*The Champion needs to be oiled before each use.  I dutifully brushed olive oil on before each use. It needed applied between the end of the auger where it spins against the base, a high friction place. It's not difficult to do, but every extra step takes time and causes more work.  Nowhere in the Omega instructions does it instruct the consumer to oil any parts. If it's a requirement, I don't know about it.\n*The Omega's chute is smaller than any juicer chute I've seen yet, including the Champion. The max sized apples slice that would fit in a Champion would need halved to fit in the Omega.\n*I mainly juice carrots. The Champion rarely had trouble doing whole carrots. It seldom clogged. The Omega struggles when it gets to the fat end of a big carrot. I have to apply a lot of pressure to get the auger to accept it, otherwise it just kind of rolls around on top of it. I hope this doesn't damage the machine over time.\n*When I bought the Champion I didn't realize it doesn't do leafy greens. A few years later I found out there is a part you can buy, but it's rather pricey so I never bothered.  The Omega does a good job with leafy vegetables. Now I'm getting my greens.\n*The Champion produced a layer of foam. The Omega hardly any.\n*Just eyeballing I think my Champion produced more juice than the Omega, not a lot more, but a little more. I notice the pulp is slightly wetter than what the Champion left behind.\n*Both the Champion and Omega are better than my husband's Jack  Lalanne Power Juicer. He used the Champion, but he's never tried the Omega. He's satisfied with the Lalanne, and thinks a the difference between a basket juicer and masticating one isn't worth consideration. I disagree, but overall I think the Lalanne is a fine juicer for the price. It's a basket juicer though, so it's not releasing as many nutrients into the juice as the masticating ones. And isn't that the whole point of juicing?\n*The Champion has fewer parts, so clean up goes a little faster. The Omega comes with a big \"toothbrush\" to aid in cleaning, which is a happy little perk.  I dislike cleaning either, but that's juicing for ya.\n*The Omega is heavy, but not nearly as heavy as the Champion. This is both good and bad. Good--because the Omega is not as cumbersome to move around the kitchen. Bad--because I think the Champion is a sturdier product and I suspect it will last longer. I haven't used the Omega long enough to decide if it's a durable, dependable machine. But if it continues to work as it does now, I'll be happy with it.  If not, then I'll wish I'd stuck with the dependable Champion.\nI haven't tried out all the Omega's functions. If I run into any issues I'll edit them in.",

We make a green drink with kale, spinach, celery, cucumber, a large red delicious apple, and a whole lime.  Not only is it delicious, the energy it gives and the overall sense of well-being are positively addictive.  If you want to lose weight, you can substitute one meal a day with this, and find it very satisfying.  With a simple, quick change of nozzle, one can make nut butters, baby food, or pasta.\nAn added bonus, my dog loves to eat pulp from apples and greens.\nThis machine is also beautiful, and we have found space on a counter so it is always ready to go.  If the price seems high, think of it as an investment in your family's health for years to come, because that is what it is.  We highly recommend this juicer!",

        "text": "Converting from a centrifugal juicer to a single-auger, masticating juicer was a great decision for me.  I pondered the idea for a few months before committing.  My decision to change was supported by some in-depth research.  Many complained that this type of juicer is too slow, too hard to clean up and produced too much foam - for me, nothing could be further from the truth.  Yes, prep takes a little more time, but this is offset by the incredible richness produced - yum!  And yes, this device looks real sharp!\nI decided on a single auger because I was not convinced that a twin-auger would really produce a noticeable increase in flavor or nutritional content - but that decision was made w/o a taste test.  I'll keep the single running for now, but will keep the door open for a twin in the future.  What did I do with my centrifugal juicer you might ask - may it RIP, forever!",

Not only does it create perfect juice, extracting every last drop from the fiber and spitting the fiber out, but I have already learned to add tasty things like mint and ginger and lemon to make it health AND delicious. It is a breeze to clean, I just rinse it off in about two minutes. This thing is fan.cy, let me tell you. My kitchen looks impressive and I have the delicious healthy green drinks (kale, parsley, swiss chard, lemons, limes, ginger, okay maybe an apple or an orange) to back it up.  You cannot possibly regret the decision to purchase this machine.",

It does a better job of juicing greens.\n3. It doesn't have sharp blades that can dull over time.\nThis weekend I decided to go on a juice fast and have been producing juice up to 6 times a day.

        "text": "I used to have the cheaper juicers with the motor that were loud and annoying to clean. I have since upgraded to the auger mechanism juicer and purchased the Omega J8006 over a year ago and it's my favorite hands down. The Omega VRT350 juicer is avaialble for me to use at work and since I use both of them regularly, I can easily say that if you are deciding between the two, definitely get the Omega J8006 juicer. There is no comparison in my opinion. Both have the auger mechanism, both are quiet, and both secrete the pulp into a separate cannister for easier cleaning. But, the J8006 is extremely easy to clean - within 2 minutes everything is spic and span. On the other hand, the VRT350 is so difficult to clean it bothers me every time because things get stuck in one of the areas, and although it comes with a brush that has a pick on the end to help get things out, it doesn't always get things out 100% and it's just a pain, especially in comparison to the J8006 that usually gets clean simply by rinsing. On the J8006 there is only one small area about 1/2 inch around that needs to be brushed when necessary. Also, I have been noticing lately that the VRT350 is producing more foam than actual juice. So take it from me, if you're in the market for a juicer get the J8006 over the VRT350. You won't be disappointed. Also, a plus to the J8006 is that it comes with a different attachment so you can make other things besides juice, for example, you can put frozen fruit and it comes out as a sorbet. I love my J8006 and hope you will too.",

It doesn't have 20 super small parts, it doesn't have to be cleaned multiple times while you are making multiple juices at one time.  It produces a very dry pulp and requires far less input than other products to yield much more juice.\nThe biggest flaw is whatever grade the plastic is.  While the juicer is generally easy to clean, after only a short time the plastic parts begin to stain and decay from the plant matter you are juicing.  While it doesn't affect the function, it is actually REALLY disappointing to pay so much for such a high quality product only for it to become kind of disgusting after only 6 months or so.  At this price point and quality, I planned on having this juicer for many years but would be surprised if it doesn't have to be replaced after only one because of how corroded the plastic pieces are becoming.",

I started to grow my own wheatgrass and the Champion does not do an adequate job of juicing the grass and greens. I have the grain mill attachment for my champion and use that often for flour and cracking grain for home brewing so the Champion is still useable.\nBottom line - if you are going to do a lot of greens or may want to try greens I say the Omega is a better machine. Make sure you cut your pieces small and don't overload it. If you are going to be juicing large quantities then I suggest moving on to a professional machine, these are designed for home use and for me this machine works well.",

        "text": "Last year I started eating  a living food lifestyle and began to purchase items for this. I have always juiced and have only had cheap ,centrifugal juicers. I was into upgrading to a $500.00 limit if that was the best juicer for me. I looked at many kinds, read reviews, really did my research. So I ordered the Omega 8006.  Now the original cost was $288.00 on Amazon, the day after Christmas I went to buy it and it was only $200.00! Great sale Amazon. I was looking at juicers without the cost factor in mind really. I wanted something excellent as I am going to be juicing every day. The $500.00 model I was looking at had some really negative reviews regarding cleaning , etc.\nThis juicer has a 15 year warranty. It is super easy to set up and clean. I did not even ask my husband for help. Best of all the juice is not heated and has very little foam.I can now make juice with kale, collards, wheatgrass, ginger etc.\nFor you foodies out there, it even extrudes pasta, makes soft serve ice cream , nut butters etc.\nI am thrilled with this juicer, I would have paid more for it but it is easily the best value in a juicer on the market.",

Yes the feed tube is small, but since I juice mainly greens it's right juicer for the job. I end up getting the long thin kale and it will mostly feed itself. I also own the \nBreville JE98XL Juice Fountain Plus 850-Watt Juice Extractor\n and it doesn't really work for leafy greens - it shoots totally undigested pieces of spinach/kale etc out into the waste bucket (if I'm doing something wrong I am open to advice). The omega is also WAY easier to clean than the breville. If you have a garbage disposal it rinses off in nothing flat. The Breville is a serious pain to clean.\nThe plastic housing for the main tube broke (I included a picture). The gasket part has broken off the main housing. It's not a huge deal but it does make the juicer unusable as veggie juice would run into the motor which sounds, you know, dangerous. Now I have to beg omega for a replacement or pony up the $25 for the part off their website. If some $25 plastic part breaks every couple of months this is going to become an expensive juicer. I will update on how the process goes.",

The Omega J8006 gets a permanent spot on the countertop. I've created an entire juicing station actually. This beautiful machine is in the center of it! I'm looking forward to nut milks and butters and fresh pasta if I could just stop juicing long enough to use it for that! I'm also making amazing marinades and sauces with this juicer.

I would recommend this juicer to anyone that is serious about juicing on a daily basis, or if you choose to do \"Juice Fasting\".

        "text": "After many hours of research, I settled on this juicer, and couldn't be happier.\nI don't want to beat a dead horse with an in depth review, as I believe many other reviewers cover the operation and performance of this juicer well. I will just list a few points that address some issues of this juicer that made me skeptical of buying when I was conducting research.\nQuick Overview - I make one batch of fresh juice (12-16 oz) before work every morning. The total process takes about 15 minutes. The points below reflect my opinions on use so far (and slightly on juicing in general).\n1.) Feed chute is too small - Hasn't been a problem for me. I buy produce for a weeks worth of juice ahead of time, cut up what I can (cucumbers, carrots, celery, kale, etc.), and store them in air tight containers. I probably spend around 45 minutes once a week doing this (washing, cutting, and cleaning up). I don't feel like this is cumbersome, and it actually gives me a chance to inspect the produce closer.\n2.) Clean up takes too much time - The juicing process takes me about 15 minutes each morning: 5 min to get everything ready (includes setting up juicer), 5 min to juice, and 5 min to clean up and put away. The juicer assemblies and disassembles in under a minute. I bought a slightly bigger brush with stiff bristles for $2.99 which makes clean up very quick.\n3.) Juicer is noisy - Hardly. Doesn't wake up roommate in other room with door shut. I was actually very surprised to hear how quiet this juicer is.\n4.) Waste a lot of the produce in the rejected pulp - This is a point I still agree with, but it is a necessary evil for me. I tried making a green \"smoothie\", but could barely choke the thing down. Plus, for my situation at least, using a blender (3 hp motor) in the morning would wake my roommate up and most of my apartment floor for that matter. This juicer does, however, seem to produce relatively dry pulp.\nSo, overall, I'm very pleased with this purchase and the juicer has worked flawlessly so far.",
