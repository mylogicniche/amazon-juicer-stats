I loose-chop the ingredients, this strong little machine basically &#34;chews&#34; them up, then I filter out the foam and tiny particles to create a REALLY smooth juice. Very easy to clean--about five minutes of clean up for all of the parts. The only thing I need to do is make sure I have enough great veggies in the house to juice! I thought the expensive juice I was buying at Whole Foods was good, but what I've made at home with this juicer is far superior, and the color of fresh green juice is amazing: emerald green versus the army green of a bottled juice. It makes getting your veggies-on-the-go so much easier.",

It does take a little longer, but the slower speed keeps all the nutrients.  The pomegranate juice is AMAZING.  I can't believe how quiet this is.  My juiceman sounded like it was leaving the runway.  The pulp is very dry and I am using less fruits and veggies to get more juice.",

        "text": "March 26, 2012:\nI have had this for 2 wks now. I bought it because my daughter's health is compromised and as she starts to heal, I want to nourish her with the best possible foods I can get into her. And I wanted my whole family to benefit from juicing as well.\nI first ordered the $99 Breville like everybody sees in the movie Fat Sick & Nearly Dead. I sent it back because it was so loud and the pulp was so wet, the amount of wasted juice was upsetting. Clean up was not easy, the screen was impossible to really clean. I decided it would be worth it to upgrade. I also wanted to get into juicing greens, and from what I gather, a centrifugal juicer just wouldn't work as well.\n(Side note: within 2 days of my ordering the Breville it went up about $50! What?!)\nIt arrived on time, well packed. It is a hefty piece of machinery, but like others said - the 'chrome' is plastic. But whatever.\nThe auger is a heavy duty plastic. The pieces that come with it seemed very sturdy.\nFor the record, I am a mom that is willing to clean & cut up produce as necessary. I do not care if I have to make pieces small enough to fit. I clean & cut up produce ahead of time so I can grab stuff & juice when I want.\nThe motor was so much more quiet than the Breville. It seemed to munch through produce & greens well. The pulp was SO much more drier than the Breville. This I was pleased with. It was no biggie to clean up afterwards. Screen cleans easily with the big toothbrush scrub brush they provide.\nSO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? You cannot even juice one apple without it getting clogged up. Now I know from reading reviews, watching You Tube videos and from practice that it is best to follow some softer fruit with something hard like a carrot piece or a cut up beet piece to push through the pulp. You need to use fresh (not mushy or old) produce.  I shop every other day for my produce. My apples (granny smith) are crisp & fresh as is everything else. My kids say - we would like some fresh apple juice, no carrot this time please. Sorry, no can do. As soon as I get halfway through as apple, pulp and juice start to back up inside. I see some pieces of apple that won't even snake through to the end of the auger. So I will say ok kids let me stick one piece of carrot through just to get things moving - stuff still gets backed up. I tried to do 3 apples, I had to clean the whole thing out 3 times to do so. That is not going to cut it with a $300 juicer.\n(I cut up my apples in slices and do not use the core/seeded sections)\nTHEN I notice this starts happening with every juice I make. Any fruit veggie combo. Hard & soft stuff: just carrots, carrot apple beet; kale celery apple, whatever - much of it is pulping up inside, clogging up the inner screen, and not coming out. Some juice comes out, but when you open it up to clean it, it is like juicy baby food inside, as well as pieces of produce not juiced at all. I started keeping track - I can make about 4 oz of juice before it starts to clog up & work inefficiently.\nI contacted Omega last week and got customer service on the phone pretty easy. They asked - how long have you owned it? A week. Are you using fresh produce? Yes. Are you using the screen not the blank? Yes, using the screen. Probably you need a new auger. They said they would send me one right away.\nSO - let's see how long it takes them to get the new auger to me, and let's hope it works. I sure hope that is all it is because I really really want to like this juicer. I will update as soon as I have a verdict.\nUPDATE MARCH 27, 2012\nFirst off, let me thank Omega customer service for getting the new auger to me so quickly. It arrived this morning, about a week after we spoke. It is a different color than the original but that is OK.\nI cleaned it up & tried it out right away. Same problem. Juice & pulp gets clogged up inside, produce pieces are going un-pulverized and just spinning in the auger as it turns,not coming out even when I put in beets or carrots. I am disappointed and will be returning this. I am bummed because I had high hopes for this juicer, noting all the positive reviews. I am a big researcher of products before I buy, esp with high price items.\nIf anyone has a suggestion for a better juicer please let me know!",

I recommend checking him out on YouTube, he makes great juicing videos and recipes for juices! He really inspired me to start juicing and taking my health to the next step. I'm vegan, and I eat raw for the most part, but juicing is definitely helping me eat more raw organic food. There are so many benefits of drinking fresh juice, and so many benefits to juice fasting and I plan on doing that a couple times a year.

I use it twice a day, everyday, and sometimes a third. It's silent, and the fiber is dry so you know it's juicing out all the juices in your vegetables and fruit. The clean up is fairly easy. Ive noticed I have had to do the &#34;mushy&#34; fruits first prior to the fibrous ones because it will start to pack up and not break down, and when I noticed the mush is building up I would help break it down by putting the more fibrous vegetable in between to help the break up. The mouth is small, so you do need to cut your pieces smaller. All in all it has been outstanding. would be better if the mouth was wider. It takes me about 5 minutes to make juice.",

        "text": "My wife and I have decided to get into juicing for health reasons. We have researched and review the pros/cons of masticating and centrifugal juicer. But we realize that fruits are usually very sweet and already juicy, it doesn't matter much if we juice it or not, the small amount of fiber doesn't really make much difference, so why buy a centrifugal. What we want is the nutrition on veggies, the kind that has more fiber than nutrition. So we decided to go with a masticating juicer, and after lots of reviews, we decided to go with the Omega J8006.\nWell, it has been 2 months now since we got it, and we are definitely glad we choose this one. We juice about once a day or once every other day. Usually we do carrots, celery, apples, kale(many different kinds of kale), beet, ginger, spinach, oranges, wheat grass. I am sure it can do more, but that's the ones we usually juice. And we have tried sugarcane too, also works. We usually juice the veggies for 2 cycles, first cycle you will get about 85% of the juice, second cycle will get about 10%, then we usually just stop there. If you want to do another cycle, you can get about another 5%, and pretty much nothing after that.\nThe most time are spent on preparation, because you do have to cut the veggies into smaller size to fit into the juicer, but once it's cut, the actual juicing time is not that slow (not fast either, but acceptable). The cleaning time is okay. All the parts can be taken apart, and there is no sharp edges, so just rinse with water and using your hand to do a overall wipe. So far there is no problem whatsoever, we are happy with our purchase, and we would recommend this product to our friends.",

I use it at least twice a week and put the extra juice in glass bottles so I have enough for 2 to 3 days. It really does a great of extracting the maximum amount of juice from fruit and vegetables, and clean up is a cinch. Anyone who says otherwise is just lazy and probably complains about making there bed in the morning.Don't let the price steer you away, it's worth it.

Also, I'm getting a smoother, pulp-free juice than I would get from a blender-style juicer--especially after I use the included screen.\nAlthough the slowest part is slicing any fruit that doesn't fit in the 1-1/2&#34; feeder tube (apples, cucumbers, etc), the quickest part is the cleaning!

It's nice for when you still have extra produce left over at the end of the week, and don't want to waste it, but can't fit it into a recipe. Here is a fair breakdown of the product:\nPros-\n- It's a masticating juicer, which allows for much of the fruit/veggie nutrients to make it into the juice\n- It's not as noisy as some of the other juicers I have used\n- Assembly and breakdown of the parts are very quick and easy\n- parts are dishwasher safe\n- The design allows it to sit under our cabinets so it can stay out in the kitchen ( more likely to use it this way!)\nCons-\n- You cannot run the pulp through the juicer a second time and get anything out of it. Any time I've tried to do this, the juicer clogs.\n- It does not juice leafy greens as well as other juicers I have used.\n- You have to be methodological as to what fruits and veggies you are placing in the juicer. I cannot juice a whole apple without it turning to mush and getting stuck in the part that rotates. I usually have to juice half an apple and then feed parts of a cucumber through it in order to push the apple pulp to the end.\n- It promises to be a meat grinder, and it simply does not serve this purpose.\nAll in all I am happy with my purchase. My husband and I are getting a lot more veggies into our diet with this product, and using all of our leftover produce. I think there are pro's and con's to every juicer on the market, and it boils down to personal preference and how much you are willing to spend.",

        "text": "I bought this juicer to complement the Breville centrifugal juicer I already had. I've heard that the auger style was healthier since it didn't generate the same heat as the centrifugal juicer. The Omega J8006 works great, but my biggest complaint is this: it's SLOOOOWWWWW. Whereas I can stick four carrots in my Breville and push them through in about three seconds, The Omega will only accommodate one at a time, and it takes probably 20-30 seconds per carrot. So it takes much, much longer to make your juice. This may not be a big factor if you are just juicing for one person occasionally, but my wife and I are on day 30 of a juice fast, so we are making a LOT of juice. Making our green juice for the next day used to take 20 minutes, but now it takes 90.\nTo be fair, I believe the Omega does extract more juice than my Breville. There is also less foam. However, I will also say that there is more pulp in the juice from the Omega than from the Breville, which surprised me. I have run the juice through a strainer once or twice before it is too pulpy to drink. If you like pulpy juice, then you may love this &#34;feature&#34;, but I'm not a big fan of chewing my juice.\nThe last gripe is the size of the chute. The Breville will accommodate a whole cucumber down the chute, while I have to cut it into quarters to fit in the Omega. Again, it takes more time to not only juice the fruit or vegetable, but more preparation time as well.\nThese are all matters of preference, so choose wisely based on your priorities. I am not saying one juicer is better or worse than the other, but they definitely have their differences!",

I also want to let people know looking for a juicer this is the one.\nI started out with a Breville icon, it&iexcl;\u00a6s a nice juicer but I wanted something that I could use to juice once a day with less oxidation. Also the cleanup time on the Breville while easy for a centrifugal juicer was time consuming the filter basket takes some time to scrub up as it is a much larger surface than the 8006.\nThe 8006 requires a little prep time up front I have to slice apples up but it&iexcl;\u00a6s really not a big deal it only takes a few seconds to cut produce to fit the 1.somthing\" feed chute. Carrots, Celery, and kale can all be put in without cutting the exception being very thick carrots. Cucumbers just get sliced lengthwise in half then again with the half&iexcl;\u00a6s into quarters. Again it takes all of 2-3 seconds to slice a cucumber.\nI found cabbage to be trickier to cut to fit the feed chute but it still wasn&iexcl;\u00a6t bad. I imagine things like broccoli would also be somewhat annoying to cut to fit.\nBut here is the thing. This juicer is faster to clean, make a higher quality juice that you can store longer, and it gets more juice out especially with leafy greens.\nbut this is the juicer you should get! No I&iexcl;\u00a6m am not affiliated with omega \u00ba\nPROS\nFAST FAST clean up 2 minutes tops!\nLow RPM means less air in your juice.\nVery dry fluffy pulp.\nCons\nA little more prep work chopping larger veggies/fruits.",

This is because it is designed to work with various types of food, like juicing fruits, grinding coffee beans and meat, and making noodles. However, it doesn't work on all purposes as advertised. For example, if you want to grind coffee beans, you need to put beans into it very slowly, otherwise it would stuck the machine and you need to reverse it or disassemble to unblock. Grinding meat never worked, it just stuck there no matter what, and the meat didn't become grains. I also tried making noodles and it works but nowhere close to noodle maker. So basically it works well only as a juicer. But takes more effort to use than a dedicated juicer. It is more expensive than a regular juicer, a meat grinder, a coffee bean grinder, and a noodle maker combined, but doesn't work as good as any of them.",

        "text": "**edit**\nI wrote to Omega, and they promptly sent me the replacement part.  They said they normally charge for shipping, but since I'd had the juicer for such a short time, they would wave it.  They also told me that when they make pasta, they roll it into snakes the size of a pencil before they feed it through!!  Wow!  That would have been useful to know the first time.  Anyway, tried pasta again, rolling the dough quite thin (though not as thin as a pencil) and it worked much better, but still made some straining noises that scared me!  But nothing broke, and the pasta was delicious.  I guess you really do need to roll it super thin, which is frustrating, but it is a fun feature, now that I know how to used it properly!\n(end of my edit)\nI've had the juicer for a month.  The juicer works wonderfully, but I just tried to use it to make pasta, and it broke the plastic end ring on the first try.  Followed the recipe in the booklet, followed the instructions, etc. Very frustrating for a fairly expensive appliance to break on its first use (as a pasta maker), and for some reason it isn't eligible for return/replacement-- even though it has only been a month.  I guess because it has been 33 days instead of 30?",

(almost daily).\nAfter reading the directions, it is very easy to assemble and use.  However, the only draw backs I have are:\n-  large fruits and vegs need to be cut down to fit into the juicer.\n- fruits such as apples, oranges, and pears clogs the filter screen. therefore juicing can take a long time.  often I would have to clean the filter screen during juicing\n- cleaning the filter screens is somewhat time consuming. I have ended up buying several more brushes, as I use mine frequently.\nOverall, I am still pleased with this juicer - far far better than the one I had previously.",

It does take a bit of time to learn which produce to juice in what order. The order matters because softer foods like berries, leafs, and even apples aren't firm enough to force their own juices through the screener. Following up with carrots or other 'firm' items pushes everything through easily.\nNote: We ordered ours refurbished and it came as if it were brand new. Highly recommend this way to save some cash.",

I didn't want to spend a lot of time having to clean this product after I juiced. This juicer is very simple to clean. It doesn't take very long at all which I love.

It took me a couple days to decide if I liked it because I had to manually press the food down a little harder than with the Champion. My Champion doesn't juiced greens well & is faulty with it's age. The Omega juices the greens well and the carrots. I'm happy with it's performance. So far I've juiced celery, carrots, dandelion greens, kale, romaine, apples, parsley, broccoli leaves. Next I want to see how well it juices wheatgrass. I've been using it most everyday for at least three weeks. It's easy to clean and put back together and it's not loud. I don't mind keeping it running while I prepare the next batch of veggies. YouTube helped me to decide to purchase with the demonstrations of how to use it and wash it.",

It is also great with harder veggies like beets, carrots, and bell peppers while still doing a good job with softer fruits and veggies.  It works best if you alternate the fruits and veggies.  The feeding chute has a thinner opening but with just a little extra prep work cutting things up it works well.  I love that we can juice ahead of time and have juice whenever we want it.  We put our juices in 16oz wide mouth mason jars and label them.  It makes it very easy to grab one and go.",

This juicer is good for juicing in small quantities, possibly one to two juices. Anything more than that and you have to consistently remove all parts and clean them as the filter gets clogged VERY easily. Also the spout to put the fruit into is very small which doubles fruit prep time as you have to cut every piece of fruit down to tiny pieces. Lastly, the instructions say not to run this over 30 min. Since it juices so slow, it's easy to take this long if you are making multiple juices!!\nVery disappointed with this product and wish I could return!!",

I had previously owned a juicer which was not masticating and it worked well, but this juicer tops it by far!!!! The big selling point for me was that it claimed to be able to juice spinach and wheat grass, and let me tell you it does a fabulous job!!! The only draw back is that you do need to cut your vegetables and fruit into small pieces.  I was used to being able to put half of an apple into the other juicer I had owned.  There is a little more prep involved, but certainly not a deal breaker for me.  Cleaning this machine is very easy.

Plan on spending time cutting and slicing.  A food processor also comes in handy for pre-chopping your fruits and veggies.  It is a little slow in &#34;eating&#34; the food and you must use the plunger constantly it seems, and I've used a few juicers over the years.  You can't just stuff and walk-away. Also it's not one you'd use to make a quick fix mid-day after a run.  It is quiet as far as food processors/juicers go.  Think of a mixer on low-medium setting.  It is easy to clean, just one twist uncouples the unit from the base in one piece that you can carry to the sink and quickly disassemble the rest of it.  It washes up nicely.  It may say dishwasher safe, but If you care about the rubber seals I strongly would be against using the dishwasher.  I just use hot water and spray off the parts.  I would recommend this to a friend.  I was going to give 3 stars, but the ease of cleaning added a star.",

        "text": "There are many in-depth reviews about his product weighing the various pros and cons that I suggest potential buyers read. My review is based on owning both this unit, and the Breville Centrifugal JE98XL juicer everyone is familiar with from Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead.\nBefore I begin, I would like everyone to know that I lost over 60 lbs. on a 60 day cleanse utilizing the Breville. So, does juicing work for weight loss? Yes. Can the Breville help get you there? Yes. However, being the owner of both units and not having any bias, I can\u2019t help but side with the Omega in every category, the first of which, is cost.\nYes, the Omega costs more upfront. However, the amount of juice extracted from fruits and vegetables is twice of what the Breville can extract. After 3 trips to the grocery store and juicing for two people, I broke even on total cost. After that, each trip was money in my pocket! If you are a daily juicer, or plan to be, don\u2019t be fooled by the upfront cost. You will make that back each trip to the store.\nCleanup with the Omega is way easier than the Breville, as there are smaller parts that basically only need a quick rinse. Noise wise, the Omega is tons quieter. I have a newborn and with the Breville, would need to time making my juice as to not wake him up. The Omega is whisper quiet. Longevity wise, my Breville broke 2 months into juicing and I had to contact the company to make use of the warrantee. Luckily, Breville HQ is literally right down the end of my street, so it was not an issue. The Omega has yet to fail.\nAnd for some reason, the juice simply tastes better from the Omega. I am not sure why, and I have no scientific basis for this, however, if you make the same juice side by side, it\u2019s very easy to tell which juice came from what machine. During my cleanse, I hit up a few local juice bars and was amazed at how much better the juice was from the bars over my Breville. With the Omega, I am on par with the pros down the street in regard to taste.\nAt the end of the day, and even with much higher price tag, the Omega is hands down the winner when it comes to juicing over the Breville. If you plan to juice for a while, trust me, you will make the money back at the market. All-in-all the Omega, for me, has made juicing easier, taste better, and kept money in my pocket.",

        "text": "Note: I give the 4 star rating because I believe that there is not a perfect juicer out there. The centrifugal and masticating both have their pluses and minuses. so picking one or another is always compromise. Here is my view.\nI did a lot of research on this, after, as many of you, saw the film Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead. I'd always been interested in juicing, and had a 30 year old Vita-mix that I could never get the results I wanted out of (not the machine's fault), so a dedicated juicer really made sense.\nI did NOT want to make fruit juices! I wanted to stay away from large amounts of sugars. I also realized how little vegetables our family really ate, especially the leafy green ones, so that pointed me towards the masticating type of juicer. While I have no doubt with centrifugal types of juicers leafy greens can be done satisfactorily with a little strategy, my research was clear that the masticating type was preferable for leafy greens. A centrifugal juicer works better on softer fruits (so they say).\nMy next requirement was due to my DNA... I do not have the cleaning gene sequence, apparently, so I wanted something that was easy to clean, and my research told me a centrifugal model would NOT meet my needs. If it was too tough to clean it will never get used (I love my Cuisinart, but it is lonely, spending time in the cupboard, for that reason).\nSo I got the Omega 8006, because it matched my kitchen better and did not have sales tax vs the 8004 (basically same model, chrome vs white). I was chicken to spend the extra $100 on the upright VTR350, as I wasn't sure how we might use it.\nSo, after 1 month+, using twice a day (minimum), here are my thoughts.\nWe love it! We enjoy juice multiple times a day (and my 16 year old son, who complains about everything, drinks it, albeit begrudgingly). We've taken it on the road to a soccer tournament, and drank juice away from home as well. It has a permanent home on the kitchen counter now (With a wife that has to \"put everything away\", that is a great indicator to how important it is to us now). We often juice as a family, with my wife washing the veggies, my son cutting them up into smaller than needed pieces (&lt;rolling eyes> I guess he likes the knives) and me feeding the juicer.\nSome of the pluses\n-If it fits in the chute, it can usually handle it. Harder produce may need cutting.\n-The pulp is dry enough that I've never looked and thought \"I could get more juice out of that\"\n-The motor has NEVER given the slightest inclination of straining.\n-4 main parts, very easy to put together and disassemble.\n-No heat build up in the juice.\n-It cleans up relatively quickly (or just drop the disassembled parts in a bowl of water for cleanup later, don't let it dry)\n-Fairly quiet. You can have a conversation standing over it (and we often do).\n-We now have massive amounts of compost for the garden.\nBasically, it just does the job!\nCons (not really cons to me, but some things to realize)\n-The chute is a bit small.\n-Hard produce will go easier and quicker if sliced\n-This is not like the commercials where they toss a bunch of veggies into the chute and WHIRRRRRRRR: Juice! It is slower and is more methodical.\n-You DO have to clean it.\n-Fresh produce takes time to purchase, and is not cheap. Do some research, and you might find organic produce worth the cost.\n-The plastic on the output cups is opaque and can stain from greens, carrots or beets if you don't wash it good.\n-If you are making juice for 2 or 3, the cup is not quite big enough to hold it all.\nSome of our experiences that might help you out:\n-You will quickly see the size of the \"bite\" the auger takes out of hard produce. I then cut the produce accordingly. While I saw a youtube video saying this juicer is not good for carrots, I find carrots are no problem, I usually halve them lengthwise (quarter for really large ones), drop them in the chute and they feed themselves.\n-I can make a simple juice (carrots, apple, cucumber & kale for 1) from a clean counter with produce in the fridge to cleanup in just under 10 minutes. You might get faster on the juice part with a centrifugal, but the cleanup evens out.\n-I read of people complaining about making \"applesauce\". Understand, this works better with fresh and crisp vegetables. Mushy or older produce may not work as well. As far as apples, Granny Smith FTW!\n-When you do encounter something that mushes (Some romaine, cucumbers, or older apples) follow the soft up with a hard (carrot, beet, celery) as that usually pushes the soft stuff thru easily.\n-The juice has plenty of fiber in it. Trust us on that one!\n-If you can handle ginger, never be without it! It's a brilliant sweetener, and a little goes a long ways. Along with lemons, can really help some people get over the \"green taste\".\nI rarely write reviews, so I hope you understand how happy we are with the Omega 8006, and I hope I've given you some information to help make a choice, because, really, it's a tough one. There are a lot of juicers out there, and I think the differences may be more personal and the type of produce you use than actual performance of the machine. So good luck!",

This juicer gets so much more juice out of my greens and also has little to no foam. It is near impossible to juice apples with this thing, it turns them into apple sauce and just stays stuck in the juicer but I just replaced the apples with organic apple juice from the store and it's fine.\nClean up is easier with this than my Breville but this takes a lot longer to process all of your ingredients. Just make sure you leave yourself about 10-15 minutes from start to cleaning when using it . I use it every day and  highly recommend it.",

It was fast, and if that's what you want that type of juicer will work great. There are many fine centrifugal juicers on the market. The draw backs to these centrifugal juicers is yield of product to juice volume. What that means, is a little juice and more wet pulp, from you product. While the centrifugal juicers fast are they are also a bit more messy. Don't get me wrong they are good fast Juicers. But. The Omega J8006 juicers, is by far slower then the centrifugal juicers, but the yield of juice to product is noticeable. Pulp is very dry, clean up is easy, and it has a smaller foot print compared to the centrifugal juicers. An other thing is price. The Omega is more money then the centrifugal juicers, but in the long run yield of product between the two, the Omega is by far better. So over time the Omega will produce more juice, saving you money on fruits & veggies. The bottom line is price and your time. While I have had both I would the Omega J8006, I found out to be a much better juicer. But if you are thinking about getting a juicer it's all up to you, and you budget. Happy juicing.",

        "text": "[...]\nDon't purchase unless you watch this youtube video first....You tube -\neujuicers.com  Omega Juicer 8004 / 8006 - part 1 and 2\nI tried to juice apples but it didn't work as I was pushing too much.  I watched the video  THEN went back to make my juice. Night and Day difference. The best apple juice.  But the best thing of all......\nIt GRATES COCONUTS!  Hallelujah.  I did NOT chop the coconut up before hand like the video shows. I removed the meat from the hard shell using a dinner knife; made sure that no hard shell was attached to the back of the meat. I used my hand to just break up the meat in very small chunks that could just drop into the hole, and if they got stuck I just GENTLY pushed down with the white plunger.  Oh my word....the cream separated, but also the grated coconut still has a lot of cream in there so you can use it to make cookies.  I froze mine for later use.\nUPDATE\nI had to add the following: If grating coconut for use in a recipe is part of your culture, you just must get this machine.  In the above comment, I used the screen with the holes/strainer.  I just tried another coconut with the bLANK/BLIND screen. Oh my word---the coconut was perfectly grated in 3 minutes!!!!! and cleanup was 1 minute - since there was no screen to clean! There was no cream separation.\nMake sure to cut the cocunut meat into small chunks (about 1/2 inch wide slices) to fit down the chute.  This time, I did not even use the plunger/pusher thing, they just almost self fed into the rotating auger.\nWow, Wow and more wow! 3 minutes to a perfectly grated coconut. No busted fingers,\n2nd UPDATE\nI froze some bananas, grapes, small strawberries (or cut the strawberries first); black berries and coconut shreds.  Then I pushed these through the chute with the blank/blind screen twice.  To die for.  Don't juice your fruit people!  Cut them up small; Freeze them then make fruit sorbet!!!  The family will LOVE this as well as the making of it!  THE BEST!\n3rd UPDATE\n- Making sorbet with this machine - worth the entire price of the machine.  No added water!!!! nor ice!!!! as you would have to do if making a sorbet in a blender. No liquid needed - just frozen fruit ( take frozen fruit out of the freezer about 10 mins before processing). How about dumping in almonds, frozen bananas, frozen cherries, frozen any fruit! You do have to run the processed fruit through the chute a second time to get a good mix. Then you can immediately place in serving cups/bowls and place the cups/bowls back in the freezer until ready to serve.  The funnest thing to do when friends are over.",

I find it a pain in the caboose. You have to stop juicing and take it apart, clean the screen and put it back together and after a few more pieces, plugs up again.\nNow I know you're suppose to alternate your produce to keep it from plugging up, and that does work great if you are making something that has that. If not, your in a long haul between washing the produce, cutting it up into small pieces, juicing, then clean all your bowel and juicer. Then you can now enjoy your fruits of labor, literally.\nMy friend has something that can take anything and all in one piece, no cutting. And it's quieter than the Omega and just as easy to clean. And it cost less that half the cost of the Omega. And sorry, I don't remember what brand it was.",

The downside is that the feed tube is so small it requires a lot of prep work. Even carrots have to be cut long ways to fit down the tube. It makes perfect juice, but you spend a lot of time at the cutting board just prepping everything before you even get started. You cannot use this juicer if you are in a hurry. It takes way more time to juice than a regular juicer where you can throw whole apples in. Visualize putting all your veggies and fruit down a 1 inch tube and imagine how much cutting and prep work that requires - that's what this is. If you have time - this is the best!",

We have had two other juicers, one worked very well but it was impossible to clean and subsequently was no longer being used.  T\nThis Omega J8006 seems to be designed specifically with cleaning in mind, and the fiber separates and come out very easily, very little gets left behind to clean.  We save the fiber to occasionally eat separately to help with absorbing toxins.  The juicer seems to do extremely well with heavy and fibrous fruits and vegetables, but struggles a little with soft, thin, leafy vegetables, however that my be true of many masticating juicers. The other thing I really love is the fiber is extremely dry, knowing that it has extracted as much juice as virtually possible.\nThis juicer has a great design, seems quite robust and versatile, but best of all, the ease and convenience of cleaning and reassembling has to be one of the best on the market, if not the best for non-commercial use.",

About a week in, the extraction cone busted and I ended up having to return the whole thing for a replacement. Kind of a hassle but not a big deal. It worked fine and after that, for 5 whole months I had fresh juice at my fingertips. Now 5 months later it wont even turn on and I am past the replacement period. I will never buy an omega product again, and I hope I save someone some time and money, as this product is expensive to be so cheaply made. It should last longer than that for the price.",

It does a marvelous job of everything I've tried to do with it (and I've been trying a lot), but the only drawback that I can say is that it is not a very fast juicer.\nI previously owned a centrifugal juicer, which often clogged the straining basket with pulp and left too much juice in the grindings tub.  My Omega, on the other hand, leaves very dry pulp in the tub while extracting a higher percentage of juice.  The only downside, as I stated previously, is that if I'm juicing before work, I have to get up earlier than I normally would to allow for the new juicer.  Maybe not a big deal to some, but when I'm rushing around in the morning, it's a bit obnoxious.\nI also love the grinding ability, as I love to make my own hummus from scratch.  The garbanzo beans blend well in a food processor, but I also toast and grind sesame seeds for a fabulous fresh tahini with the Omega.  Smooth, creamy, and delicious!",

Yes, it is a little slower than a centrifugal juicer, but you definitely get more juice from your greens, etc. We learned quickly that it was best to cut the vegetables into about 1&#34; lengths, i.e. carrots, celery, apples, and cucumbers. The smaller size vegetables fall into the auger a lot better. Also, the feeding tube is pretty small, so this works best. I also like the staging tray at the top of the tube. We also love the fact that it cleans up relatively quickly. Right now the pulp is going to the neighbor's roosters, and rabbit, and they like it. We also purchased the Chrome color, which was about $50 more, but it was worth it. It looks very nice in the kitchen. We keep the motor unit on the kitchen counter, and we placed the other parts in a small tub we purchased, and keep them inside the pantry. So, in conclusion, this is a wonderful masticating juicer well worth the money. For you gals out there, my wife's nails are no longer breaking! Ya!:^)",

Only drawback (may be perception of centrifugal is wrong) that I observed is it cannot manage fruits like strawberry, mango. Whenever I try to put them in juicer I get mashed fruit put.

The kids are involved as they like to feed the fruits and veggies into the juicer.\nAssembling the attachments are simple.  I read the instructions once and taught my children how to do it.  Now they like to assemble it before they feed the fruits and veggies into the juicer.\nWe\u2019ve juiced Kale, Spinach, cucumber, zucchini, apple, carrot, celery, pineapple, beets, etc..  The fruits or vegetables need to cut into small pieces in order to fit into the chute of the juicer, approximately 1\u201d in diameter.  Now the kids like to cut the fruits and vegetables before they assemble it, before they feed the fruits and veggies into the juicer\u2026.;)\nWe continue to eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but we supplement our diet with AT LEAST one glass (sometimes 3-4) per day of fruits and vegetables that we otherwise would not consume.  At first, I wouldn't say I felt a deference in my health or energy level, but now thats we\u2019ve being juicing for about two weeks, I definitely feel more energentic and healthy.  I have no appetite for fried food, or salty food, or any unhealthy, empty calories.\nThere are several juicer available.  Initially I was about purchase a deferent, more expensive juicer, but after reading multiple reviews, we got this one.  We are very happy with this juicer and would recommend this juicer to ALL!\nDO IT FOR YOUR HEALTH!!!",

        "text": "Bought this juicer after much hesitation, obviously because I'm new to juicing and the price is steep. But for a first time juicer, I'm COMPLETELY happy with the quality of juices and ease of operation. I will probably sound like most reviewers if I write detailed review on &#34;how to&#34; so I'm gonna skip that.\nWriting this review only to help with the dilemma that most people go through before buying an expensive gadget like this, just like I did. If you are serious about creating a  lifestyle with juicing at least 3-4 times a week, then this machine is totally worth buying. Do your research and watch out for all the &#34;do not&#34; that prior users have listed. Other than that, it's just like running a blender. No regrets at all and I'm happy with this juicer!\nThere are tons of videos and stuff out there to show you how to use this and get the best out of this machine. But the secret lies in the right selection of ingredients. Juicing might seem like &#34;Oh yeah, just go buy veggies, group them based on colors, dump them all in the juicer, drink without enjoying it and pretend to like it just for the health benefits&#34;. NOPE! You don't need that much ingredients if you are juicing daily/every two days and the key is to go for the right combination of veggies.\n Try out different recipes and come up with your own combinations. For me, mostly two-veggies or three-veggies combinations have worked well and I get to save money and enjoy tasty and healthy juices at the same time. It is all about creating a set of veggie combinations to make yourself a regular juicer. Also, I juice only for breakfast and when I crave some special juices in the evening. Spend an hour or two per week and plan for the entire week. It's that easy!\nBTW, when the package was delivered, the body of the juicer had a crack and so I had to return it. Called AMAZON and the customer care person  took care of it like a superhero; the return package pick up was scheduled and he ordered a new piece that got delivered in two days, even before the pick up happened (with prime, of course). Overall, I AM SATISFIED with the service and performance!",

My purchase was made 19 days ago - Dec 27, 2016.  Seems that is a change in policy from years ago because I see reviews from then where people were returning them.\nThat said, if you want excellent juice with minimal pulp - then this is the machine.  You can also take the pulp that feeds cleanly out the end and make soup, etc, with it.  You don't have to scoop the pulp out of the internals like with a centrifugal juicer - which also means less stopping to clean the machine part way through juicing a large quantity of fruits/veggies\nThe downside:  Like all juicers - both masticating and centrifugal - it is a very slow process.  I am not the fastest person in the world for sure.  But *after* cleaning and cutting up my fruits and veggies so they were ready to go into the machine - it took 45 minutes to turn the following into 88 oz of juice - 7 granny smith apples, 4 cucumbers, one head of celery, two very large heads of kale, one lemon, hand-size amount of ginger.\nTwo weeks after buying this I bought a Vitamix 750 and I am never looking back.  That makes smoothies rather than juice - have to open your mouth wide to &#34;drink&#34; it - but it is better for you (more fiber) and WAY faster to make than using any type of juicer.",

        "text": "Since spending $300 on a juicer was entirely out of the question, I bought a refurbished one through Amazon at a significant discount. I have always had good luck buying refurbished high quality products (KitchenAid, Breville, etc.), and this juicer has been as good as new so far. This is the second juicer I've owned, and I can definitely say that this masticating juicer makes clean up so much easier than the cheap centrifugal one I had before. You do have to use the pulp screen, but it is worth it for clearer juice. I use the pulp to make vegetable broth (boil, then strain), or use the root veggies like carrots in baked goods. Clean up is a breeze, and juicing itself doesn't take too long either. It looks about the size of a large toaster, and the chrome finish fits right in with my other appliances.",

As long as you do the prep work of cutting fruits and vegetables into small enough pieces it works great. 1/8 of an apple goes right down no problem. A carrot, however, works best if cut into 1 inch pieces. It is very easy to clean and assemble/disassemble. When I emailed my registration card into Omega they responded quickly to confirm receipt. Attached is a picture of grapefruit juice, which I a was able to make in about 10 minutes for half the price of high quality store bought juice.

        "text": "I hate kitchen counter clutter, and have been buying appliances that multitask to cut down on the things that sit out (Kitchen-aid mixer, hand-held immersion blender with attachments, etc.) So when looking for something to liquefy our fruits and veggies, it was a tough fight between the Vitamix and this masticating juicer. Price won out at the end: Immersion blender (Westinghouse, which makes nuclear reactors) makes truly good consistency of soups and smoothies; couldn't justify $500+ for that; plus, the heat of a blender tends to disperse nutritional benefits. I got this on black Friday, which made it more lucrative and have been using it almost every day.\nSo easy and safe (and quiet!) that, after washing and rough-chopping the ingredients that make up our standard morning cocktail (typically handful of kale leaves, a beet, two carrots, a stick of celery, a tomato, an apple, and a tiny piece of fresh ginger), I let my 3-year-old put them in. He really gets into it, likes to mash down the veggies with the stick. And, bonus, gulps down what he's made every morning.\nA few gripes: Can't really juice tomatoes or fruit that are too soft, or must follow with something hard (like a carrot). If you mash down on crumbly fruit (like red apples that are past their peak), you'll get debris in your juice and must use the sieve (which is included). I really do hate, finally, throwing the (very dry) remnants of all the veggies and fruits in the trash. Live in a town home (in environmentally disabled Texas), so compost no use to me. Someone told me best thing to do was to put it down the disposal, so that's where it goes every morning.",

This machine is very intuitive to use and comes apart for cleaning in a snap. The pulp is very dry ensuring that all of the juice has been squeezed. I specifically bought the 8006 model because the grinder is black, as are most of the components that come into contact with the veg and fruit, causing less staining than the 8005 model. The noise level is not bad. I was able to talk on the phone and watch a show on my iPad while juicing. For a slow juicer, it took less time than I thought to make 2 different 16-oz juices (about 35-40 minutes), including cleanup. I look forward to making this a part of my daily ritual!",

I wish I bought this 5 years ago (if they even made it then).\nThis thing is easy to juice with, it's easy to clean, the parts are high quality. The parts that would eventually wear out are cheap to replace if ever needed (I haven't needed to yet).\nHere's a good easy to make recipe: 1/3 of an organic bunch of celery, a medium bowl of organic kale, 1 organic lemon, 1 yellow or orange bell pepper. Makes a great daily juice.\nThe ONLY reason I'm giving not giving it 5 stars is it can be kinda noisy, depending on what you are juicing. But it's a small complaint.",

It is a very quiet machine and the sound of the motor is faint, but it is powerful! Our previous juicer sounded like a small aircraft taking off in the kitchen when we turned it on. I can make 32 ounces of juice (typically kale or collards, carrot, cucumber, celery, lemon, apple, beet root, and micro greens) in about three minutes after the vegetables are cut to fit the chute. I also make nut butters with the machine and I understand it makes pasta as well but I haven't tried that. Assembly and clean up is a snap. Only five pieces to assemble and clean. Neighbors and friends are amazed at how quickly I can disassemble and clean-up. One thing I really appreciate is that the juice is as cold as the vegetables were in the refrigerator so I get a clean, cold green juice every time. I do wish the chute were larger but I am willing to cut the veggies to accommodate the chute because of all the other great features. We researched for several months before landing on this choice. It is a great value and we have no regrets on this purchase!",

The high end stainless steel is of the highest grade and looks attractive in the kitchen. As for the quality of juice extracted from this legendary machine - it is phenomenal. The juice is cool and refreshing. We are learning to drink green juice relative to our individual health issues. It's a wonderful way to invest in our health outside of health insurance payments and MD visits as needed. Oh yes! This machine is not loud. I would say a low, comfortable humming sound. There are juice extraction machines that are ferociously loud. Least of all this juice machine is so tremendously easy to assemble and &#34;CLEAN&#34; !!! 2 minutes to clean up this machine by hand!!!

The Omega juicer is easier to clean and gets more juice out of your vegetables and fruits.

If you really struggle with wrist problems you may want to reconsider. Or, at least keep the sharpest knife on the market. Over all I think it takes about 4 to five minutes longer to get the same juice but I enjoy the process much much more. It feels more relaxed. In hindsight, the noise and speed of the centrifuge juicer made me feel anxious.  I like that the juice doesn't separate in storage. I like how it &#34;chews&#34; and crunches the produce. And I don't notice any textural difference in carrot juice for example. For me, easier parts storage in a small basket in the cupboard,  with not near as much room taken up drying on the counter after washing, a big plus for apartment living. Also, does greens better. And this is not to mention all the additional food prep uses it is good for!  Very happy I made the switch",

We originally started with a centrifugal juicer but the juice tasted bitter within a few hours.  When we wanted to switch to a masticating juicer, we did some price comparisons and read reviews all over the web.  This juicer had the most recommendations of all of them, even though there were new models in this series.  We could not be happier.  It does have a few quirks that you will find with any horizontal masticating juicer that you have to keep in mind, and if you do, you'll be happier and better off using it.\nIf you must use celery, make sure it's cut in to 1-2 inch slices or the strings wrap around the drill.  For apples, mangoes, pears and other really soft fruits, alternate it with something hard that has a lot of fiber or the funnel will fill with juice and start pushing pulp through.  This is simple common sense; and it can work very well if you make sure you're using fiber to push it through.  I like to chop up all of my fruits and veggies, put them in strainer in the sink under cold water, mix them well and feed them through a handful at a time.  If you must have pure apple juice, you can still do it well.  It does best with about three apples at a time.  If you want more, take it apart, clean it, and keep going.  It comes with a wonderful little strainer to strain that pulp out, and is incredibly easy to clean in comparison to the centrifugal juicer we had.  The best part?  It tastes absolutely amazing in comparison.",

        "text": "We have been longtime fans of drinking green smoothies and we love Sprouts' fresh juices.  Instead of paying $5-10 each time we wanted a drink we figured we could juice it ourselves for slightly less, so we finally took the plunge on a masticating juicer.  This Omega juicer works great to that end.  Let me say up front that you need to be committed to juicing before you drop several hundred bucks on something like this.  Juicing can be a time consuming process, so if you don't have 15-25 minutes each time you want a drink, this will sit on a shelf and collect dust.  If that doesn't make you weak at the knees, then you'll find this juicer to be of great benefit.\nA few tips we've picked up along the way:\n- Softer fruits will clog up the juicer and require you to take out the components and clear the pulp from them.  This happens almost 100% of the time with things like pineapple or other fruits that have a lot of 'meat'.\n- The smaller the chunks/slices the better.  If you shove 1/4 of an apple into this thing, it's going to take longer to juice.\n- Follow up soft pieces with hard pieces.  For example, pears are soft and if you just juiced one or two you would have to take the Omega apart and clean the pulp out.  If you follow up a pear slice with...a sliver of carrot (not sure you would juice those together, but you get the point) it will push more of the pulp out of the machine.\n- Clear the juice screen as you juice.  The fine mesh really does catch a lot of stuff and if you want all of the juice you worked so hard for, clear the screen or it will retain some of the juice.\nHappy juicing!",

It's the first juicer I've had that produces more juice than pulp, it seems like the cheap centrifugal juicers throw a bunch of wet, juicy pulp into the waste bin.\nExpensive?  Yes, almost 3 times what you pay for a decent centrifuge.  But I can already tell that my produce goes a lot further: More nutrition, more juice, and a small pile of dry pulp.  You could seriously starve a rabbit with the meager little pile of pulp this thing turns out.\nOverall very happy.  Not sure if that's from the juicer or the juice I just drank, but I'm happy.",

You would need to practically dice your fruit and veggies in order for it to fit through! Takes up a lot of time to do that.\nI'm returning this juicer and will look into champion juicers.\nI have had a 20 year old champion juicer for 4 years now and it's been a workhorse for me.

Still, the only things that go down whole are limes, if peeled, carrots, celery and other stalks of greens (beet & radish tops, kale if pushed hard), and other typically-thin produce. Other masticating juicers can accommodate larger pieces.\nFor ~$50 more, I'd buy one with the larger chute.\nCaveat: I live in a small town with one grocery store that doesn't currently offer a great selection of multi-sized produce (like mini-cucumbers).

Our first juicer, a Breville juice fountain, is great but it cannot do some things well, and wheatgrass is near impossible. A friend recommended an Omega J8006 Nutrition Center juicer. We are not disappointed!\nI was impressed at how sturdy the unit is, and better yet how simple it is to clean. Just a few small pieces, and they are actually small enough to fit on the top shelf of our dishwasher, unlike the Breville's top-shelf only pieces. This thing can plow through carrots and sweet potatoes like they are nothing, and the result is nutrient-rich, hearty and healthy juice. The juice produced by the Omega doesn't separate as profoundly as juice produced by the Breville, and seems to have a longer shelf life. The only fruit I've had an issue juicing is tomato. The screen on the juicing filter plugged up with seeds and it managed to spit out a blob of red that looked more like tomato paste instead of juice. That's okay, though, because the Breville still does a decent job (but not especially great) at juicing tomatoes.\nOne of the other reasons we purchased the Omega J8006 Nutrition Center was its ability to make nut butters and milks, in addition to extruding pasta dough! This little juicer is full of surprises that we haven't even begun to explore, though it does help turn out a beautiful, creamy and healthy almond milk.  I will update this review after we have had a chance to make peanut butter and other nut butters.\nWould I recommend this juicer?  You betcha!  It's one of the best investments I've made in our health and wellbeing in a long time.",

Everyone loved it and my wife even said she doesn't want to go back to dried store bought pasta because it was so good.

        "text": "I love when I research a product thoroughly before buying, feel good about my choice and then am still amazed by how much I love it once I'm using it.  This thing is such good quality and works so well.  People who say it's hard to clean must be doing the cleaning after everything has dried on.  Most everything just slips off under the water, except for the strainer part, and that's still really easy to do a quick scrub on with the included brush.  Then I toss in dishwasher (except I handwash the containers so they'll last longer, painless.)\nOther people have included really detailed info about the pros of this, and I can only add my shout to theirs.  No juicer will ever be perfect for every little thing.  If you want to do greens, a masticating juicer is a must.  And this will not damage the enzymes.  No heating.  And on mixed juices, start with a hard one (carrot, beet, etc), then keep alternating soft and hard, then end with a couple more hard, then the soft stuff will pass through easily 95% of the time.  For straight apple juice, do firm varieties or just really fresh apples in the fridge overnight.  For pineapple (yum), fridge overnight and start and end with a core piece.  Gets a little mushy, you lose a little, but not much and the juice is amazing.\nI also love how quick it all goes.  I don't mind cutting up the food some for a quality machine.  But this thing is still a power house.  Some i cut as I go.  But all in all, I can have a good mixed juice on my lips in 15 min, from the time I walk into the kitchen, incl clean up.  CLEAN UP BEFORE YOU DRINK.  :)  I did have one juice take me almost 25 min, but it was several ingredients (6 or 7?) and I was doing it with my boys.\nThis machine is so straightforward my 5 yo can put it together.  He's also made almond meal by himself.  He and his 3 yo brother love to add the fruits and veg when juicing.\nFor almond meal, run the almonds through twice, no more!  So great.  For nut butters, keep dumping them back through about 6 times for smooth.  Made almond milk by soaking almonds in a jar of water overnight, then spooned the almonds sloppily with water into the tube.  Run the fiber through a second time.  Needs straining for my taste, but was so easy I went off my homemade nutmilk strike.\nWe did the frozen banana &#34;ice cream&#34; too.  Definitely leave the bananas out for maybe 15-30 min before.  Solid frozen doesn't work.\nHaven't tried making flour yet, which I'm dying to do, but understand from a youtube video that it's not the best for that, comes out more like a cracked wheat.  Plan to try anyway and maybe send through a couple times.\nThe directions say not to put the strainer on top of the container where the juice goes, but I do it every time.  Only once was it so thick that it backed up (I juiced a banana which you really shouldn't do, but it turned out pretty great in the juice).  I just pushed my finger around on it until it went down and resumed juicing.\nIf you can't clean right away, put everything in the sink covered with water so it will be easy when you come back.\nThrilled with this purchase.",

        "text": "This is so much better than the centrifugal kind of juicers.  It only turns at 80rpm and it removes the pulp so you don't have to manually remove like the centrifugal type.  What a step up in mechanical superiority this machine is.  The moving parts can be taken off in seconds and washed in the sink in no time.  It extracts juices from any leafy greens, including wheats grass, etc which the others can't do.  The pulp is much drier (extracts more juice) than the others but without the messy cleanup.  You gotta get one of these even if it is a little more expensive than the other types of juicers.  This thing is meant for heavy duty use and made of material that won't break.  It is silent and therefore the quality is excellent.  You can tell from the first time you juice with it that you made the right choice.  Two thumbs-up!!!",

I've got two major beefs with this device:\n1) The pictures make the chute look MUCH bigger than it actually is. It's tiny, you really have to slice fruit thin in order to get it in. I could've lived with it if it weren't for the fact that\n2) It doesn't juice soft fruits very well. Almost not at all. Berries come out more like a jelly or a syrup (if you're lucky). It gets clogged quickly and you have to disassemble it, clean it, and then put it back together if you want to continue juicing.\nThe fact that they advertise this as a fruit juicer is a joke. I wasn't expecting miracles but I also wasn't expecting something as bad as this. I've attached a picture of just how gelatinous the &#34;juice&#34; really is. There was also a thick chunk of fruit jell that I pulled out from the casing when I was cleaning it, around the area with the very tiny screen to separate the juice from pulp at the end.",

That it retained the most amount of nutritional value of the vegetables/fruits because of the masticating feature. And it's fantastic because it also has a FIFTEEN year warranty.\nI had heard that the masticating feature meant that it was slow, and that you had to leave a lot of time to make your juice. I totally disagree. I think this is fast and efficient and the most healthful product.  It takes me about 15 minutes from start to finish, including washing my vegetables AND cleaning up, and I am making a high quantity of juice for 3 adults.

It's very powerful, I've juiced broccoli, kale, spinach, carrots, ginger, garlic, apples, grapes (vines, included), sugar canes - the machine is unbelievable strong enough to take on the things we need to break down. I also tried juicing lemongrass and if you're familiar with them - lemongrass and sugar canes are very stalky.\nOh, I almost forgot to include the easy set up and easy clean up. I do not have a lot of time. I worked far from home - already on the road while it's still dark and get home, when it's dark. I don't have a lot of time to set up and clean up, for juice. Trust me, I juice every day because of the ease of use of it. Honestly, I include skins, seeds, vines and all. :-)\nMy only negative thing is... The slot is a little small.

The juicer disassembles very quickly for cleaning that takes less than 2 mins to do in all including cleaning.  The veggie waste is dry as this juicer extracts the max amount of liquid that has very little foam and the juice doesn't get heated up like the high speed juicers cause.  The plastic containers that catch the juice and liquid are very high quality, but seem a bit as an after thought on the otherwise beautiful and simple design of this unit.  My only dislike is the hopper is small requiring lots of prep work and cutting.

I read that with this masticating juicer juices can be stored from 24-72 hrs (without losing too many nutrients). In addition this juicer is so versatile!

But I also cut my produce up into smaller pieces, it puts less pressure on the screen. This makes great juice and the best part is it is really easy to clean. The problem I had with the 'spin' type of juicer was the parts so large I had a hard time managing them under my faucet and getting them cleaned. This has small parts, like a meat grinder, that come apart easily and clean up fast. I also like that it lets some of the fibers through. They include additional screens if you need to get the fiber out, but I find its 'just enough' for me. I've been using this now 3 or 4 months and just love it. It is sturdy, seems to be very well made and I'm very happy with this purchase.",

I wanted this juicer because I wanted more juice out of the pulp and less force when feeding it..also..I do a ton of greens like kale and spinach,celery,parsley,cukes as well as carrots and apples etc etc. It is very powerful and gets more juice out of the pulp than the other two I have.I slice everything up a lot smaller just so it goes thru without a hitch.The only thing I dont like about it is that if you do berries like strawberries etc...the seeds go thru the first screen. But...since I use this for mostly veggies not a prob. The champion does berries excellent...no seeds at all in the juice. I love all three of my juicers but I use the champion for pineapple and berries and fruit and the omega for everything else. Theyre both easy to clean and do a great job. But with the champion my wrists (carpal tunnel)would get really sore from having to\nuse force in feeding it produce. With the omega...it pretty much does all the work..and I have to say..greens are not a prob whatsoever where as the champion was a real pain about it lol. Hope this helps someone...great juicer so far..have only used it a few times but all in all would recommend to others. :)",

I will keep an eye on it. Other than that small detail it works just great and have had no problem. It juices everything I put in the beast. The other thing is that you HAVE TO CUT UP your fruit and veggies to fit the tube or they get stuck, this take a little time but it's not big deal for me, just saying. It extracts plenty of juice and over all I am really pleased with the unit.",

The reviews I've read about the plastic breaking is due to people putting the parts in the dishwasher, these parts are NOT dishwasher friendly. The dishwasher will make the plastic brittle and cause breakage. Stop giving bad reviews because you're too lazy to handwash. Also this has a pretty good warranty, and the parts are relatively cheap. It's easier to clean than any other juicer on the market, it's juiced everything we've put through it, even almonds for milk. I don't use the pulp screen because I prefer pulp. If you don't like pulp use a different screen and funnel to seperate it, it works better. Haven't tried out the other attachments, we mainly juice.",

But after buy several brands, I decided to finally spend the money for it, hoping to get what I was looking for! Boy did I! It is exactly what I was hoping for. I was very surprised that it not only juices, it makes nut butters, nut mylk, baby food, jerky, minces food and much more. I juiced almost a gallon worth. It did take a long time, about half hour. But it didn't get overheated or even shut down. I juiced several hard things, such as beets, ginger, and carrots, and greens like kale and spinach. It juiced everything great, did not overheat it and the pulp came out pretty dry. I also loved the easy clean up and just rinsed it. It came with a handy brush to help clean the screen. I am glad I spent the money, it will save me, now that I don't have to go to the juice bar daily. I also love how it does not oxidize, so it stays longer in the fridge. I can juice every three days for those 3 day. So it save time, juicing daily. I highly recommend. It is even better because it is not a single use item, it can be used on several things!! Happy Juicing!",

I happened to find this model on sale and went for it and so far this thing crushes all the vegetables I've thrown at it to pieces.  I'm not sure about other reviews talking about pieces breaking with the auger or other parts failing but so far this thing is solid!  I'm not sure if they're following recommended usage as the instructions clearly state that you should cut some of your vegetables into smaller pieces.  Of course, I do this with parsnips, carrots, beets or anything that's more of a root vegetable or basically any hard vegetable.  Leafy vegetables you can somewhat throw in as is although you probably should chop it into slightly smaller pieces.  Will catch pretty much all of the pulp and even comes with a small strainer that you can place over the bowl that catches the juice.  Highly recommended machine if you're thinking about juicing instead of blending vegetable smoothies.",

In short, this Omega is one of my most prized possessions. I even like it better than the new design because you don't have to mess around with an adjustment nozzle on the nose. You just cut and push. I know the new one gives you 15 percent better yield, but I still would hate messing with that nozzle, rotating my produce from fruits to greens and turning that thing every time.

What I ended up with was a very expensive machine I was ashamed for spending so much money on and hated using because it was so tedious and cumbersome of a process. I tried all the tricks and tips, but still ended up spending most of my time disassembling and reassembling the parts because it would get clogged with pretty much anything I put in there. Since I had to take apart the machine so frequently, of course I'd have messes to clean up after each clog. After a year and a half of owning it and being too demoralized by the time consuming effort for little success, I admitted defeat that I simply wasn't juicing because of the frustration level of  this machine. I ended up purchasing a Breville centrifugal type of juicer and not only was it cheaper than this machine, but it's zippy! It may not be a purist way of juicing compared to the masticating machines, but at least I'm juicing daily now with no hassle at all. This machine is horrible and not user friendly.",

        "text": "I discovered the masticating juicing method through a friend who had a similar machine. I was impressed by how fast the juice came out and even more so that a fair amount of juice came out of parsley (not something I can do with my usual centrifuge). I looked on the internet the description of the diverse extraction method and was convinced - it seemed that I had to get one of those machine and the Omega also came recommended in my research.\nIt is all of what I was thinking it will be. The huge practical benefit is the easy cleaning. You can really clean this under 2 mnts and all parts are simple to clean, have easy reach sections so no hassle and problems with sticky residue in crevasses and corners. This really adds to the juicing - you can afford making fresh juice when you want or need it. I can go for up to three a day and do not see the problem with cleaning.\nThe extraction is painless\n- the machine is easy to assemble and disassemble. Note: the lowest rating on the reviews tended to indicate a grinding of the plastic but I can hardly see how this could ever happen - the auger adapts perfectly at the end of the juicing screen so I cannot even imagine how those findings can be validated mechanically.\n- the machine is really silent (some squeaking sounds may happen when you juice grassy vegetables but nothing out of the ordinary)\n- I juiced grassy and hard vegetables (kale, red cabbage, parsley) without any problem. The ginger went through and produced quite a bit of juice (this will be good for other reasons - extracting juice our of spice for recipe will be one of my own usage of this machine). Perhaps, the try with blueberry tended to end into some thick pulp which did not really go through but everything else went through (I assume bananas would do the same and end into a puree)\n- last but not least, several people recommended to clean first and appreciate the juice afterward and I agree - it is so easy and cleaning immediately will prevent to have stains (I juiced beets for example and if you leave on the plastic, it may get reddish / for sure. Immediate cleaning is also easier than letting pieces dry and since it takes less than 2 mnts.\n- the amount of juices you can make is endless  since you can juice about everything - so, let your imagination go and enjoy.\nOverall, I highly recommend this machine and even recommend to forget about centrifuge (any kind). This is the way for anyone serious about juicing.",

That means you have to cut the food into very small peices for it to even fit in the spout. Thats a huge problem. The food also gets caught in the grinder very often & you have to disassemble the parts, remive the food & start all over. The strainer does not work because food particles are still in the juice which voids the term juice and makes it a smoothie if sorts. Over all a HORRIBLE buy. Not to mention they are hasseling me about my refund now. The brevil I initially purchased was the better option.",

        "text": "Years ago I bought a centrifical juicer and it was so noisy and messy that it ended up growing dust on the shelf unused. After watching \"Fat, Sick And Nearly Dead\", I decided to try adding juice to my routine for better health. This time though, I wanted one that was affordable, quiet, efficient and easy to clean. I spent months researching and finally picked this one. It has been everything I hoped for. The 15 year warrenty gives me peace of mind as well.\nI had reservations about the plastic auger, but after months of use it is just the same as when I took it out of the box. As others have said, it is quiet enough to converse next to it while running. I love that it is so easy and quick to clean. I put some hot, soapy water in a mixing bowl while juicing. After juicing, I can have it disassembled, washed and drying in just a couple of minutes. Use the included brush to get into those few places that food sticks.\nThe juicer is very efficient. Depending on what you are running through it, the pulp comes out fairly dry. The harder the product going in, the dryer the pulp coming out. It DOES do citrus, but I would recommend a regular citrus juicer for it and leave everything else to this. If I could change one thing on this, it would be to make the feed chute a larger diameter. I understand the reason for keeping it small - to keep too much product from being forced into the auger too quickly, but I would prefer not to have to spend so much time and effort cutting up the product.\nI have made all kinds of juice, nut butters, pates, and even sorbets out of frozen fruits. I will NEVER go back to a centrifical juicer again! If I had to do it over, I would buy another one of these without a second thought. Save yourself time, money and headaches and just buy this juicer, you won't be sorry.",

        "text": "One day I woke up and decided that I wanted to be healthy. You know, one cant just become healthy over night. My goodness, it takes so many baby steps its ridiculous. But the very first step is deciding that being healthy is your goal and that you'll do whatever you need to do to reach that goal. Not gonna lie, I hopped on pinterest and started looking up pind on exercise and healthy eating. Sooooo many pins came up on smoothies and juicing. Well I already own a blender that sounds like Minja. And I love making smoothies, and I have gotten pretty good at it too. But I needed to take the next step and that seemed to be juicing. To really extract nutrients and put it in my body in a way that would directly benefit it. I mean aside from injecting it right ?! Joking. Anyway, once I decided that juicing was my next step I had to do some research on a amazing juicer. I was going to do this half-@ssed you know. I wanted the best of the best. And that led me to this juicer. Hands down one of the best. It is easy to assemble, easy to clean, you can feed it the food without issue (has a great guard for hands), and this baby seriously pummels anything that comes its way. I even let my almost 2 year old feed it the veggies and fruits, and she insists on having the juice as well. Talk about starting good habits. I really cant say enough great things about my Omega. He is a fixture on my kitchen counter and even has a name (not gonna tell you, haha). He is so super easy to clean by hand, but I give him a good cleaning in the dishwasher every 3 or 4 uses.\nSo if you are in the marker for an amazing juicer and dont mind dropping the bills, THIS is the one to go with.",
